            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But beſides this, the good affection and reſpect you bare to the Author while he liued, makes me hope you will bee as forward to patronage his Worke, as you haue been found willing to be helpefull to his ſonne. And indeed (Right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) the worke for the ſubiect matter of it
<pb facs="tcp:13967:4"/>
is ſuch, as may worthily challenge all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe in you to countenance it: it treates chiefly of faith, that royall grace, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects peculiar, ſo pleaſing to God, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for by the Saints, which to defend is the higheſt honour of Princes, to liue by the chiefe glorie of Chriſtians. But why goe I about to ſhew the worth of that, which none can know but thoſe that haue it? Oh! thoſe that haue <hi>taſted how good the Lord is,</hi> whoſe ſoules are ſweetly refreſhed with that <hi>peace that paſſeth all vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> rauiſhed with thoſe <hi>toyes vnſpeakable and glorious,</hi> who are <hi>ſtrong to ouercome the euill one, the world, themſelues,</hi> haue power <hi>to worke righteouſneſſe, obtaine promiſes,</hi> yea, <hi>to doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them</hi> (and all this can beleeuers doe); ſuch beſt know what faith is, and how much they owe to God the Authour, and the inſtruments it pleaſeth him to vſe in this bleſſed Worke. Amongſt other helps this Treatiſe may be one to all that liſt to vſe it; penned by one, who (to ſay no more) himſelfe liuing by faith, and feeling
<pb facs="tcp:13967:4"/>
in his owne experience the ſauing effects of that heauenly gift, knew what he ſaid when he intitled it, <hi>A Jewell of toy, and peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pearle.</hi> The earthen veſſell which brought this pearle is now broken; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken doe I ſay? or rather made whole for euer, caſt anew in the mold of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and filled with that glorie whereunto it was prepared. Had it pleaſed God to haue ſpared him longer, my comfort had been the greater, and this work perfecter: yet ſuch as it is, to Gods people it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and from them I for my part durſt not detaine it. It was no childs part in <hi>Micah</hi> to ſteale that ſiluer, which his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Iudg. 17.</note> had dedicated <hi>to the Lord,</hi> (ſhee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) though indeed to an idolatrous vſe; much leſſe were it warrantable for me any way to ſeeke to keepe backe, what my Father bequeathed to the Church, to ſo good an end. And this I ſay, though but a mite, yet if caſt into the Lords Treaſurie, when God accepts it, no good man will diſdaine it: though but a few barly loaues, yet it is good they ſhould be diſtributed,
<pb facs="tcp:13967:5"/>
when through Chriſts bleſſing thouſands may be fed thereby. If any man ſhall think the Treatiſe might be ſpared, becauſe of the commonneſſe of the ſubject, faith and repentance being the ordinarie theames of mens Sermons and writings, I wiſh him to conſider, whither the Iſraelites did well to be angrie, when riſing in the morning they found Mannah fallen againe about their tents, of which before they had had ſuch plentie. Well, <note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 6. 32. 33</note> 
               <hi>Moſes gaue them not that bread from heauen, but God the Father giues vs the true bread from heauen; for the bread of God is he that commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life to the World,</hi> the ſame is receiued by faith, that bred by the Word; and this, how ſoeuer through Gods vnſpeakable mercie to this Nation, the Preſſe and Pulpit ſo much ſound with it, is a bleſſing to be imbraced with all thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, not loathed for the commonnes. But if this ſuffice not, let him anſwere Chriſts interrogatorie; <hi>When the Sonne of man commeth, ſhall he find faith on the earth?</hi> If no faith, ſurely as little repentance?
<pb facs="tcp:13967:5"/>
Shall then Gods Seedes men withdraw their hand, becauſe much hath been ſowne alreadie, when as ſo little comes vp? Nay verily, ſo many as truly <hi>beleeue on the name</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>of the Son of God,</hi> wil acknowledge they ſtil neede Saint <hi>John</hi> ſhould <hi>write vnto them, that they may beleeue on the name of the Sonne of God:</hi> as for the world that abides in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, the truth of God where it ſhines moſt clearely, ſhall haue that effect which Chriſt foretold the Spirit of Truth, the bleſſed Comforter ſhould haue at his comming, euen <hi>to conuince it of ſin, becauſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 19.</note> 
               <hi>they beleeued not on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither, I hope, will the manner of handling vſed by the Authour, and the kind of phraſe farre from affectation, or the entiſing words of mans wiſdome, I hope (I ſay) this will not offend any, who are content their <hi>faith ſhould ſtand not in the wiſdome of men, but in the power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I returne to you (moſt worthie Knight) to you principally I offer this Treatiſe, this field (if ſo I may call it) wherein the Pearle of faith is diſcouered.

It is not for me to teach you how you are to account thereof; your wiſdome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but approue that high eſtimation, the Merchant in the Goſpel had of the Pearle.

               <hi>Apollos</hi>) an eloquent man, and mightie in the Scriptures, inſtructed in the way of the Lord, and feruent in the ſpirit, and ſpake and taught diligently the things of the Lord: a man of indefatigable paines, both in his priuate ſtudies and exerciſes; and alſo in the publique worke of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie; to the great benefit of the Church of God, ouer which the holy Ghoſt had made him an ouer-ſeer: and finally he was a iudicious and pious Diuine, well ſeene and practiſed, eſpecially in theſe points of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, wherof he hath here written. So that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Author doth deſeruedly commend the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as alſo the nature of the treatiſe may wel commend the Author; with whom in the birth thereof it fared as with<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 35. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Rachel,</hi> who died in trauell: whereupon

though this abortiue orphan may, in regard of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thereof, well brooke the name<note n="c" place="margin">The ſonne of my ſorrow.</note> 
               <hi>Benoni;</hi> yet for our due eſteeme &amp; vſe thereof it may fitly by vs be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note n="d" place="margin">The ſonne of my right hand.</note> 
               <hi>Beniamin.</hi> The reaſons mouing this our Author to write any thing for publique vſe, as one of vs hath obſerued them from his owne mouth, was firſt, for that he being reſtrained from benefiting the Church by the ordinarie courſe of his miniſterie, hee was both willing and deſirous to be ſeruiceable and helpfull to the ſame, in what he might, by this way and meane. Secondly, he ſeeing the people generally both peſtered with many needleſſe idle vaine pamphlets, and multitudes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous hiſtoricall diſcourſes; and alſo much encombred with manifold polemicall diuinitie tractats, of curious and litigious points, tending rather to contention and diuiſion, then to godly edifying, and that many good and neceſſarie bookes were more framed to giue ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the learned, then to edifie the ſimple: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might in a ſubſeruient manner endeuour to ſupplie the preteritions of the latter ſort of bookes, and to helpe to iuſsle the former rotten rapſodies out of place; he thought it expedient, that treatiſes of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie matter, concerning the eternall ſaluation of all, handled in ſo plaine a manner, that the meaneſt may vnderſtand, ſhould alſo be obtruded vpon the readers, at the leaſt if it were but to interrupt and hinder ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the reading of ſuch bookes as be either hurtfull or vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that he might leaue in ſpeciall to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and<note n="*" place="margin">Lee.</note> congregation, to whom he was a carefull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, a particular remembrancer to bring to their minds ſome chiefe points of his former doctrine, taught
<pb facs="tcp:13967:8"/>
amongst them; which upon their ſecond meditations thereof, they might the more affect and regard; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to bequeath ſome note of his good affection to his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing friends and well deſeruing acquaintance; this treatiſe did he entend and fit for them, often to peruſe and well to reſpect as the laſt farewell and loue-token of their deare friend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the treatiſe it ſelfe; though it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both for the extent in parts and meaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and alſo for the manner and forme of the ſame, ſo that now it commeth farre ſhort of that perfection, which was intended, and would haue been performed by the Author, if God had not taken him away before that he could finiſh or reuiſe it: yet ſeeing for ſubſtance and matter, it is touching iuſtifying faith and ſound repentance; without which none can be ſaued; neither doth any periſh but by defect and error in theſe two: therefore is this diſcourſe thereof moſt worthie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent peruſall and conſideration of all; who may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in finde a new diſcouerie of the manifold ſlights of the diuell, and deceits of the heart; whereby many men be cunningly coſoned of their ſaluation: and heere ſhall they haue vnfallible markes and ſure direction, how both exactly to trie and certainly know the ſoundnes of their ſpirituall eſtates.</p>
            <p>The methode and phraſe of this diſcourſe is indeed plaine and familiar, fitted of purpoſe for the capacitie of the meaner ſort of people; for whoſe good eſpecially it was intended. For though the ſimpler ſort cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand euen plaine things in an artificiall methode, briefly expreſſed in proper and quaint tearmes of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and art; yet people of better vnderſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:13967:9"/>
can eaſily conceiue profound things vnfolded but in an ordinarie phraſe of ſpeech, and vulgar order: it being farre eaſier for the ſtronger to yeeld and condeſcend to the weaker, then for the weaker to aſcend, in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of their power, to the ſtronger: ſo that the ſame ſpirituall food is ſo diuerſly to be dreſſed, that to the one it may bee ſtrong meate, and to the other milke. In regard of the which plainneſſe, with the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of truth, this treatiſe is the more to be eſteemed; for that without all coloured masking, the naked truth is therein ſimply pronounded; with the pure beautie whereof al are to be enamoured: and ſeeing herein the Author hath more regarded the ſpirituall good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then to gaine any worldly reſpect to himſelfe; it is not the leſſe, but the more remarkable and worthie of eſteeme.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to come to the cauſes of publiſhing hereof,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I (to whom the Author vpon his death-bed did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely bequeath this Treatiſe, as a poore orphan vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, to bee wholly at my diſpoſing) had no ſmall doubt and conflict within my ſelfe, whether it were beſt to keepe it as a domeſticke ſeruant in priuat, or to let it be made free and publique. Two reaſons did much moue me to the former, firſt, reſpect to the Author, our reuerend friend, for that in this knowing age this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortiue birth not perfected fully to anſwere either his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s expectation, might ſomewhat diſparage him. Secondly, the many good and godly treatiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie publiſhed vpon the ſame ſubiect, did deterre me from doing ſo with this, for that it ſeemed to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; notwithſtanding I haue bin perſwaded to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, firſt, that I might cleerely manifeſt my fidelitie in
<pb facs="tcp:13967:9"/>
that which was committed to my truſt, for the vſe and benefit of others, who both earneſtly expected, and often flagitated the ſame from me as their owne, what or how euer it were. Secondly, that the Authors diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour and true intent not only while he liued, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo after his death, to edifie the Church of God might be euident to all, for the help and encouragement of others in all good courſes: whereupon I haue ſurrendred this orphan vnto the naturall elder-brother of the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by him to be ſent abroad. The learnednes of the age is ſo farre from being any iuſt diſcouragement, that it is rather to be an encouragement to publiſh ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie treatiſes, ſo long as they are orthodoxe for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though they doe want ſome ornaments of garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, proceeding not from want of power in the Author, but of opportunitie in time; ſeeing that then there ſhall not want ſufficient and equall Iudges, both by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of veritie, and alſo by the Chancerie of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, who will pleade for equitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for neuer true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but ignorance is an enemie to truth. The diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and multitude of ſeuerall treatiſes vpon one ſubiect, (ſo long as none of them is ſo abſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly perfect, but that ſomewhat may be ſupplied by others thereunto, neither is any of them ſo vniuerſally fit for all perſons, times and places, but that according to diuerſitie of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they may be various) is no barre to exclude o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſame nature: for ſo long as they doe all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the ſame ſubſtance of truth, though they do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the manner of the frame, phraſe, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, according to the varietie and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the graces of Gods ſpirit in the Authors, and the diuers diſpoſitions, manners, and opinions of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:13967:10"/>
people, in ſundrie places and ages, to whom they doe write, thereby an vnanimious and vnde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is publiquely giuen to the truth; and the Church and people of God ſtill built vp in goodneſſe. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though there were ſufficient alreadie written, if men would carefully vſe it, and therewithall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; yet ſeeing that old bookes, like old garments, are in time neglected and deſpiſed; and the new coueted and read rather for the nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ltie of the edition, then for any newneſſe of matter contained in them; it is not amiſſe ſo to renew bookes of the ſame things, for the ſpreading and continuing of the truth, euen as they ſay by new Phenixes riſing out of the aſhes of the old, their kind is ſtill propagated. But bleſſed be God we do dwell in the land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> hauing the two great lights of preaching and printing, as the Sunne and Moone to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and comfort vs, in the ſeruile Egypt of this world: therefore while wee haue the light, oh how carefull ſhould wee be as the children of light to walke in the light, that at the laſt we may raigne with God for euer, who dwelleth in light, which cannot be approched vnto; which the Father of mercies grant vnto vs. Amen.</p>

                  <hi>life</hi> with God in Chriſt Ieſus. Faith ſetteth the heart at peace, and ſecureth the conſcience: it giueth better and more ſtrong aſſurance then any bond of the beſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, though made in Statute-merchant: nay, then can doe the bond or aſſurance of any Prince, though they ſhould lay their Crownes in pawne, or be bound in the forfeiture of their kingdomes. For faith hath Gods truth laid in pawne for the making good the aſſurance: and God hath bound himſelfe in the forfeiture of his truth (which he will not loſe for the whole world, and is vnto Gods maieſtie of greater weight and regard, then is the ſtate of a kingdome to any Prince), that he will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no more a God of truth if hee faile in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

               <p>Secondly, and as wee are to know, that in perſon hee was right wonderfull, and in worke no leſſe powerfull; yea moſt ſingular, moſt glorious and excellent: ſo are we to know that the offices were moſt high and honourable, vnto which he was aſſigned; and which he bare vpon him

for the accompliſhment of the ſame: as being annointed of God to thoſe offices of greateſt dignitie and reſpect, both before God and man, of being our high <hi>Prieſt, King, and Prophet;</hi> by whom we might be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, deliuered from the hands of our enemies, ruled by his lawes, guided by his teaching, and ſhewed the <hi>path and way of life,</hi> that ſo in the end we might bee ſaued by<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 11.</note> him.

               <p>Q. <hi>Beſide the true knowledge of Chriſt, in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you made of faith, you ſaid there muſt be a laying hold of Chriſt, with a perſwaſion that God will be fauourable to vs, in and through him?</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Indeed that laying hold of Chriſt is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">To lay held on Chriſt.</note> to be ioyned with our knowledge, and in no caſe may be wanting: for therein is the maine difference found to be, conſiſting betweene true iuſtifying and <hi>ſauing faith,</hi>

               <p>This laying hold of Chriſt, that we may reſt vpon him to make him our owne, and to get our part of ſaluation out of him, is the chiefeſt worke about which true iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſauing faith is to be occupied, and moſt buſily to be employed: which is no other then a placing of our affiance, and repoſing our whole truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſt for ſaluation.

               <p>There is indeed a different laying hold of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the differing degrees of faith, that are found to be among them that doe beleeue: according to the free diſpenſation of this grace giuen out vnto euery one by him that is the <hi>authour and finiſher</hi> of the faith of all the<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note>

In like manner, when any thing is looked vpon by the eye, the obiect that is looked vpon, is in the eye that doth ſee it; and at the ſame time in the mind and vnderſtanding, that doth diſcerne that which is ſeene; and ſo the ſame obiect is both in the eye, and in the mind at one and the ſame inſtant apprehended together; the eye by looking on a thing, becommeth one with it after a manner: to <hi>looke</hi> then to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is after a fort to <hi>lay hold</hi> of him; and ſuch a kind of looking to him, as cauſeth a diſtreſſed ſoule in greateſt extremities to

Herein the goodneſſe of God did yet ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-abound, that it would pleaſe him to couenant with man the ſecond time for life and ſaluation, making a <hi>new couenant;</hi> which is ſaid to bee a better couenant then the<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 31. 32.</note> former, becauſe it is ſtabliſhed vpon better promiſes (our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> himſelfe being the Mediatour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of),<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6. 7. 8. 9.</note> euen the Couenant of <hi>grace,</hi> for the obtaining of life and ſaluation freely by his grace, through the redemption<note place="margin">Rom. 3 24. 25.</note> that is in Chriſt Ieſus, and through <hi>faith in his name:</hi> whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, and price of redemption for al that beleeue, with this promiſe made to euery ſuch a one, that whoſoeuer doe beleeue in him, they ſhall neuer periſh, but haue life euerlaſting. And<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> that by Chriſt all that doe <hi>beleeue,</hi> ſhall be iuſtified for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from all things, from which by the <hi>workes of the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 13. 39.</note> none could be iuſtified. Now this being the ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant for life, the promiſes whereupon this is ſtabliſhed, are ſaid to be better promiſes then the former, becauſe it is not ſaid, <hi>doe</hi> this, and thou ſhalt liue; but <hi>beleeue</hi> this, and thou ſhalt liue (there being a poſſibilitie of obtaining power at the hands of God to beleeue, if we be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our ſelues).</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though this ſecond couenant for life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, be a better and more fauourable couenant, then was the firſt; and the condition thereof more eaſie to be performed through the aide of Gods grace, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13967:32"/>
giuen to ſuch as ſhal be ſaued: yet (leſt any ſhould faile to doe that, which otherwiſe he hath meanes to bee made able to doe, and ſo might doe, namely, beleeue) herein Gods exceeding goodneſſe vnto man ſeemeth more abundantly to be ſet forth, in that he leaueth it not as a thing indifferent to the choice of euery man whither they will beleeue or not, but as that which is moſt neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for all, he chargeth all that they doe beleeue; that is, that they be not wanting to themſelues in vſing all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes, whereby they may come truly to beleeue. So that if any ſhall now periſh vnder the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> wherein ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is offered vnto vs, vnder the condition of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, ſuch ſhall periſh; not ſo much for their other ſins, as for their <hi>vnbeliefe,</hi> becauſe they beleeued not in the<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 18.</note> name of the onely begotten Sonne of God; and they ſhall die twice damned as double tranſgreſſors of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, both of the <hi>Law</hi> commanding them to do, and of the commandements of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> commanding<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 23. &amp; 4. 1. 6.</note> them to beleeue; and as violaters of <hi>both couenants</hi> of workes and of faith, not keeping the conditions of either; neither <hi>doing</hi> that which the Law commandeth, nor <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing</hi> that which the Goſpell promiſeth. Vnutterable therefore is this goodneſſe of God, that commands vs to beleeue, that wee might bee ſaued; who thus thought it not enough to prepare ſaluation for vs, and to proffer it vnto vs, but preſſeth it vpon vs, and vrgeth vs to take it, charging and commanding vs to beleeue: which is the onely hand, by which ſaluation is to bee laid hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the knowledge of this, that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to beleeue, may bee our warrant for our making ſure to our ſelues our owne ſaluation, and for our ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 10.</note> beleeuing, without all manner of doubting to be ſaued by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and to haue redemption in his blood, euen the forgiueneſſe of all our ſinnes: as alſo to free vs from that falſe imputation charged vpon vs by our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, of being too preſumptuous thus boldly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13967:33"/>
to beleeue (and not to remaine as they doe euer in ſome doubt), ſince it is <hi>obedience,</hi> and not <hi>preſumption,</hi> to doe that we are commanded, God thus commanding vs to beleeue.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the practice of this knowledge that it is our dutie to beleeue, ought to be ſeene in our carefull ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring by taking all poſſible paines, and vſing with all diligence the good meanes of reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> of hearing of <hi>Sermons,</hi> of often partaking at the <hi>holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> of priuate <hi>conference,</hi> of holy <hi>meditation,</hi> of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and continuall <hi>prayers;</hi> ſo to get the ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as wee may bring our hearts to reſt, and relie vpon him and vpon him alone for our ſaluation; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending him to be our Sauiour, and laying hold vpon all that he hath done and ſuffered for vs, as that whereby a full ſatisfaction hath been made for our ſinnes, and a price hath been paid of value ſufficient for our perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: that ſo we hauing Chriſt with his merits by faith to be ours, in hauing him we may haue life by him: for God hath giuen vs eternall life, and that life is in his<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 11.</note> Sonne. We are euery where counſelled and called vpon to get faith and to labour to beleeue. It is the ſpeciall worke that our Sauiour ſet the people about, which hee ſaid to be the <hi>worke of God,</hi> to labour to beleeue. We are<note place="margin">Mark. 11. 22. Iohn 6. 29.</note> willed to <hi>haue faith in our ſelues,</hi> whatſoeuer elſe wee ſhould want beſide. And no marueile, for of all other graces it is that which is moſt needfull, without which euen Chriſt himſelfe ſhould profit vs nothing. It is the <hi>mother grace</hi> of all the reſt, and roote from whence all vertues beſide doe ſpring and flouriſh out: it is a <hi>iewell</hi> of vnualuable worth, and <hi>pearle</hi> of an vnſpeakable price. Among pretious ſtones, the faireſt tincture is giuen to<note place="margin">Excellencie of faith.</note> the Ruby, and the quickeſt light vnto the Diamond: but there is no <hi>Ruby,</hi> no <hi>Diamond</hi> nor <hi>Saphire,</hi> how coſtly and pretious ſoeuer they be, that may be compared with it for brightneſſe and beautie; or that can in like manner inrich, deck and ſet foorth the outward man, as this doth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13967:33"/>
in rich the heart, beautifie, decke and adorne the hid man therof. There is not the like pretious ſtone euer to be heard of, hauing ſuch vertue to be found in it, as hath pretious faith, which is the faith of Gods elect. No not that ſtone (if euer ſuch there were) which being caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea when the ſtorme is at the higheſt, and the waues thereof moſt troubleſome and horribly raging, (as ſome haue conceited and ſtick not to report) to quiet and to calme all the boiſterouſnes thereof: yet were not that worke ſo wonderfull and change ſo great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous, that thus ſhould be ſeene done in the foaming wilde ſea, as is that which is moſt certainly and that vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and daily found to be wrought and done by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious faith in the afflicted conſcience, in the perplexed ſoules and trembling hearts of the diſtreſſed ſeruants of God. Who encountring with the tentations of the diuell, and wreſtling in conſcience with the wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, as for life and death, are ſorely ſhaken with the terrors of God, and blaſted with the whirlewinde of his diſpleaſure; which is able to driue the whole frame of our nature into extreame miſerie and vtter confuſion: eſpecially when Satan with all (taking the aduantage of ſuch opportunitie) moſt furiouſly doth breake in vpon thoſe diſtreſſed hearts with ſuch force and violent rage of his dreadfull tentations, as is able to lift the minde off the hindges, and to teare vp the very foundations of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from the bottome; the ſtorme of tentations being ſo at the higheſt, the poore diſtracted and diſtreſſed ſoule is then as the raging ſea that cannot be quiet; but is like to<note place="margin">Pſal. 88. 6. 7. 15. 16. 17. 18.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13967:34"/>
the hands, the voyce and the eyes vpward, as it wil keepe all ſafe from drowning, or finall miſcarrying in the end; and will neuer giue ouer working in the effectualnes of the operation thereof, till it hath obtained helpe from God, and till ſafetie and deliuerance be fully come; till by his helpe who <hi>ſtilleth the rage of the ſea, the noiſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>

                  <hi>and tumults of the people,</hi> theſe heauie tempeſts and ſtormes of tentations may be made wholly to ceaſe, and all be made peaceable and comfortable, yea ioyfull again: aſſwaging all ſorrowes, expelling all feares, bringing quietnes to the conſcience, refreſhings to the ſoule, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the heart at peace with God, and cauſing that the <hi>peace of conſcience</hi> as a ſweete ſleepe, may fall vpon ſuch<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> tired and wearied ſoules, that were well neere worne vp and waſted with diſtreſfull griefes and ſorrowes before, that ſo they may now returne to their owne <hi>reſt</hi> againe.<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 3. 6. 7.</note> Theſe be indeed worthie of the name to be called the <hi>faire Hauens,</hi> into which faith (where it may be allowed<note place="margin">Act. 27. 8.</note> to be Pilot) will bring out of the greateſt flawes and fearefulleſt ſtormes (that can happen) the poore diſtreſſed ſoule ready to wracke; that ſo in all ſafetie at the length, the ſame may be thruſt in here, and moſt quietly and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againe reſt therein, as in a moſt ſure hauen. Theſe with the like being the effects, which are wrought in the hearts of true beleeuers by this pretious faith (euen in the hearts of ſo many, as it can finde way and place giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it to ſhew the operation thereof), they are ſuch as are moſt worthie both to be marked and to be marueiled at: when as in the ſtead of the horrors of conſcience, and the ſound of feares which affrighted them before in the times of their troubles, Gods ſeruants are yet againe ſo cheared and comforted in the end, as their change ſeemeth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be celebrated with the ſongs of Angels and the reioycings of men. Wee wonder at the vertue of the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> that it ſhould euer be pointing at the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole,<note place="margin">Called <hi>Magnes</hi> of the great vertue that is in it.</note> and that it ſhould draw ſo forcibly the heauy yron vp to it ſelfe, contrary to the naturall motion thereof.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13967:34"/>
God hath put this admirable vertue into faith, that it is euer looking vnto Chriſt alone, and pointing vs only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; it faileth not to draw home moſt effectually Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour into euery ſoule in the which it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and lifteth vp againe vnto him the heart of euery true beleeuer (how heauie ſoeuer), coupling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an vnion, though true and vnſeparable, yet euery way ſtrange and moſt vnutterable. Faith followeth Chriſt as doth the flower follow the Sunne, which hath the name giuen it vpon the ſame to be called the flower of the Sunne: becauſe it is euer ſeene turning it ſelfe to the Sunne, when it doth ariſe and when it doth decline. Thus doth faith euer turne it ſelfe vnto Chriſt, it looketh<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16.</note> after him alone, and after none but him; which worthily is therefore called the faith of Chriſt, and the faith of his name. This ſauing grace which commeth from aboue,<note place="margin">Acts 3. 16.</note> and hath his beginning from on high, as it commeth from God, ſo doth it leade vs to God againe; it moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs aboue the world, and ſetteth vs vpon the power and prouidence of God, aſſuredly to looke for and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to beleeue to haue (without failing) all that he hath promiſed, who ſpeaketh in righteouſneſſe and is <hi>mightie</hi>

Mightie is the working of that faith that is not fained, to get helpe and ſauing from Chriſt for euery ſoule that hath it: yea ſo powerfull and effectuall is the working of it in this behalfe, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſtand in the way to hinder it from Chriſt which it will not remoue, nothing can be able to keepe it from Chriſt. It burſteth through all things, not onely that wee haue in our ſelues, but whatſoeuer elſe is in earth, heauen or hell, vntill it come to <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> and to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſweete mercies of God in Chriſt Ieſus.

how much the greater be the vnlikelihoods and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that lay before faith, by ſo much the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and excellent doth faith ſhew it ſelfe to be in the working thereof, and wreſtling to ouercome all that ſtands againſt; ſtill riſing vp from vnder all her burthens, and running on with greater force when it meeteth with lets in the way to ſtop her courſe, taking ſtrength euer from reſiſtance. If way be not made for it to get vnto Chriſt, it will make way for it ſelfe, whoſoeuer or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is that may ſeeme to reſiſt. It is not a poore ſilly garment, that can ſtand in the way of it to hinder it from <hi>touching Chriſt</hi> to draw <hi>vertue</hi> out of him, but it will<note place="margin">Mark. 5. 27. 28. 30. 34.

them in any manner of ſtead. This is his ſubtilty and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſh policy, with the ſhewes of nothing, to make men beleeue they haue all things; and when they are emptie, to thinke they are full. This is truly ſaid to bee one of the chaine-ſhot, wherwith he ſlayeth thouſands vpon thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: and with which (as it were) with the Iaw bone of an Aſſe (<hi>Sampſon</hi>-like) he daily doth make heapes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heapes.

They are like fooliſh and deſperate perſons, that dare goe to ſea in a rotten or riuen ſhippe: or like the fooliſh man, of whom our Sauiour ſpeaketh in the Goſpell, that <hi>buildeth his houſe vpon the ſand,</hi> looking to bee ſheltered there, and ſaued from all harme againſt euery ſtorme; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>ſtorm co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth &amp; beateth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his building, all falleth</hi> about his eares; and the fall therof is the greater, by how much the more he hoped, and was conceited in himſelfe that he had built it ſo ſtrong, as it could neuer faile him in any need.

There bee that doe trauell as painfully to bring it forth, and doe with as great difficulty and hardneſſe come to finde and to feele that they haue it; as any weake woman by her foreſt labour when ſhee endureth the ſharpeſt brunts, and ſtrongeſt paines of trauell in child-birth, commeth at the length to bring forth her fruit. So that in reſpect of their hard comming by it, and the paines they endure for it, and charge that it coſt them

at the length to obtaine it, &amp; become owners of it, it may well be called and reckoned in their account to be indeed pretious faith (according as it is in it ſelfe, in regard of the ineſtimable worth that is found to be in it, and of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable effects that it cauſeth, and of the precious fruites that it doth bring forth, it moſt worthily and deſeruedly hath that honourable ſtile and title put vpon it, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>precious faith</hi>), for it is vnto ſome the price (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)<note place="margin">2.

So this ſort of people they are deliuered of this kind of faith, without any aide of Gods Miniſters; they are ſo healthie, ſo luſtie, and ſo ſtrong, as themſelues doe deeme, that they neede none of their helpe: for they are not acquainted with the pangs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the new birth, whereby others are hazarded: there being many a poore weake Chriſtian that is ſeene to lye trauelling, to bring out true ſauing faith in ſuch weakneſſe, as they are ready to faint and giue ouer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euer that can bee brought forth and ſeeme to bee borne. But theſe of a ſudden, growing great, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bigge with a windie conceit that puffeth them vp, make their reckoning that faith is formed in them: they trauell indeed about it, but (as the Prophet ſpeaketh) <hi>they trauell with the wind,</hi> and bring out nothing but the<note place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 7.

Others thinking their faith to bee greater then it is, and that they are richly ſtored therewith, when they are wholly emptie of it, and haue not of it in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſo much as is the leaſt graine of muſtard-ſeed. Who therefore haue no cauſe to be ſo ſecure as they are, and to reckon vpon ſuch ſafety as they doe: for vndoubtedly their faith ſo failing them, &amp; they from miſtaken grounds deceiuing themſelues, they cannot but periſh in the end, and wofully at the length miſcarry for altogether.</p>

We all are ſicke of that ſore diſeaſe of the falling<note place="margin">Falling ſicknes.</note> ſickneſſe; we are in danger of falling in euery place; we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13967:46"/>
know not where, we know not when, nor wee know not how wee may fall. How would men troubled with that kinde of diſeaſe make of a receipt, that were good againſt the falling ſickneſſe to keepe them from falling? <hi>Peter</hi> hath here giuen vs ſuch an excellent receipt, as will make a preſeruatiue remedie moſt ſoueraigne to keep vs from falling: we may be bold vpon it the better, and the more comfortably receiue it from his hands, becauſe hee that preſcribeth it was one that was ſicke of the diſeaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that fell grieuouſly, and yet was cured of it. The remedie is made of theſe ſimples that are here ſet downe. How then are theſe graces worthie the looking after, that wee may gather them and get them (the greater quantitie is euer the better), and put them all together, that they may haue their kindly working in vs, and wee by them may ſo worke in our owne ſaluation? How comfortable is the labour wee take about them in daily practiſing of them, ſince <hi>Peter</hi> doth warrant vs that ſo long as we are found ſo doing, wee ſhall be ſure neuer to fall? If after this manner then we ſhall keepe a working, we ſee that good aſſurance may be gotten by our ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we ſhall be ſure comfortably to worke out our owne ſaluation, till that which is moſt ſure in it ſelfe be alſo fully aſſured vnto vs. The further a man goeth hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on this courſe, and keeping ſtill his hand at this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed labour, as his ſaluation doth ſtill gather vpon him, and is much <hi>neerer</hi> vnto him then when he <hi>firſt beleeued;</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>But if the working out of our owne ſaluation, after the manner as you haue ſpoken, would bring vs any comfort, or further increaſe our aſſurance of ſaluation: why doth the

Apostle adde, that we muſt doe it in feare and trembling?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That feare and trembling which the Apoſtle there<note place="margin">Feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling needfull.</note> ſpeaketh of, is not contrary to the boldneſſe of faith, or to the aſſurance of ſaluation, and of God his vnchangeable election: whereby thoſe that are once knowne to be the Lords, are ſure for euer to remaine his: but dependeth rather vpon theſe, and is to be ioyned with the ſame. For as the ſaluation of the faithfull is ſafe and ſure in it ſelfe: ſo hath the Lord appointed, that in ſuch as ſhall be ſaued by meanes of this awfull fearing and trembling, which as a double bridle holdeth them hard in, and keepeth them from ſinning, and by this carefull endeauouring and working the things that are good and meet to be done; both that ſame aſſurance of ſaluation ſhall be euer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it ſelfe, and likewiſe be made the more ſure vnro them that are moſt ſtrict to hold on in this courſe, and keepe themſelues cloſe within the compaſſe of theſe lyſts and limits thus ſet them, without daring once wilfully to aduenture any way to breake out of them. This feare and trembling may well haue (and indeede ought to haue) this good and holy vſe to humble vs, and to breede a watchfull circumſpection and care ouer our ſelues in all our waies, and cauſe vs by a holy iealouſie of the hidden corruption that is within vs, and of the many infirmities that hang about vs, to preuent the danger of thoſe ſinnes that otherwiſe we might fall into: but not wholly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may vs, or put vs out of heart, which might enfeeble our hands to goe on with this worke. This ſhould worke a care that may driue away ſecuritie, not a feare to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the boldneſſe of faith; but a feare of falling into ſin, leſt thereby we ſhould offend our mercifull father, and he hiding his countenance, we ſhould then become trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and looſe our former comfort: not a feare of falling from grace, and from out of Gods fauour for euer, that ſo he ſhould take his mercy from vs for altogether. Feare and trembling in the working out of our owne ſaluation may ſtand vs in this ſtead, the better to looke about vs,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13967:47"/>
that nothing be wanting which is neceſſary in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be done, leſt we ſhould faile in the end, and fall ſhort of our reckoning. When wee haue once begun to take vp this courſe, and are entred vpon that way that ſhould bring vs to life and happineſſe; or paſſing on with feare and trembling as wee are a going, may become a good meanes to cauſe vs to <hi>ſet ſtraight ſteps, and make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>paths to our feet, leſt that which is halting ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of the way.</hi> They may well ſerue as two ſharpe ſpurres to both our ſides to pricke vs forward, and cauſe vs to trauell the harder, &amp; ply vs the faſter, making ſpeed in our way, leſt we ſhould be caſt too much behind; or ſo runne, that we ſhould not obtaine. Our caſe by our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and by Gods mercy prouiding a remedie to ſaue vs from periſhing (if we will looke out for it in time) is not vnlike the caſe of one among the Iewes, that had vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſlaine a man, and Gods mercifull indulgence vnto ſuch a one for the ſauing of him, by appointing Cities of<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 41. 42.</note> refuge for him to flie vnto, that there he might be reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaued out of the hands of the reuenger of blood: now we may well thinke there was no need to bid ſuch a man runne to that Citie; for if he were taken before hee came thither, he was in danger to be ſlaine: and though he ran toward that Citie neuer ſo faſt, yet wee may eaſily conceiue he ran not without feare and trembling all the way as he ran, leſt the reuenger of blood ſhould haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taken him before he ſhould haue gotten thither. So is it with vs; Chriſt is our onely refuge and <hi>propitiation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>for our ſinnes:</hi> if we be taken out of Chriſt, we are loſt for euer. Should we not plie vs then with all poſſible haſt to get vs vnto Chriſt; and labour with the Apoſtle, aboue all things in the world to take ſuch a courſe as we may be <hi>found in him,</hi> not hauing our owne righteouſneſſe, but<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> the righteouſneſſe which is by faith in his name?

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>fleſh, but after the ſpirit?</hi> haue we not cauſe then by faith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13967:48"/>
to get vs into this way with all the ſpeed that may be, and to ply vs as faſt on in it after wee be once entred, as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can? and will any blame vs if we doe not all this without feare and trembling, ſeeing there is ſo much danger on euery hand? For if either wee ſhould miſtake the way at our firſt entring, or goe out of the way againe after we had once well begunne, or ſlacke our pace as we are a going, that heauen gate ſhould be ſhut before wee come, all were loſt with vs, and wee were vtterly gone; if we had a thouſand liues they would periſh all without any redemption. Is not feare and trembling then wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily remembred by the Apoſtle in this caſe; and not without great neede commended vnto vs, which are ſo good helpes for vs, and fit meanes to remedie all this, that will not ſuffer vs to abide ſecure, but ſtirre vs vp with all carefulneſſe to looke well about vs in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect? And where it is conceiued that ſuch fearing and trembling would hinder our Chriſtian reioycing, and daſh all our comfort; let mee adde this for a concluſion about this point; that as the ſweeteſt ioyes doe many times ſpring out of the bittereſt griefes, and out of the loweſt bottomes of the deepeſt ſorrowes, the higheſt ſprings of the liuelieſt and moſt laſting comforts doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes fall out to be found and fetched forth: ſo out of this feare and trembling, leſt in any thing wee ſhould be wanting that were needfull to be done for our attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſaluation, a moſt comfortable boldneſſe and moſt ſolide aſſurance of our firme ſtanding in the ſtate of grace and ſaluation, will at the length bee fetched and wrought out as by a ſtrong hand. For what ſhould make vs to doubt or cauſe vs to feare any more, if Gods ſpirit hath pronounced peace to all ſuch as walke according<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 16.</note> to the rule that himſelfe hath ſet downe for their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, giuing his word and promiſe that there ſhall bee no condemnation to ſuch, as walke not after the fleſh but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit.

vs in this behalfe, and to ſay for vs, that ſuch hath been our moſt vſuall and moſt ordinary courſe: who ſhall then ſtand vp to make vs afraid; or what ſhould hinder the ſtableneſſe of our comfort, and the aſſurance of our peace? Nay, hauing warrant from God to goe with this meſſage, and to ſay to him that walketh in his righteouſneſſe, <hi>it ſhall be well with him:</hi> I would meeting<note place="margin">Iſa. 3. 10.</note> with ſuch, greet and ſalute them: as did the children of <hi>Beniamin</hi> greet and encourage <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſaying, Thine are we <hi>O Dauid,</hi> and with thee thou ſonne of <hi>Iſhai, Peace,</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> When the ſeed of God his Word, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall<note place="margin">How faith is diſcerned,</note> and abideth euer, whereof this precious faith is begotten, is once ſowne in our hearts, and becommeth ſo bleſſed there, and proſpered from aboue, as it ſhooteth out this bleſſed bud, and cauſeth this pleaſant plant of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith (how tender ſoeuer it may appeare to be at the firſt), to ſpring vp as from a moſt ſure laſting and liuely roote, full of ſappe and good nouriture, ſo to feede and cheriſh it alwaies, as it can neuer die afterward, till wee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13967:49"/>
be ſaued. In whom it is ſo planted, that this ſauing faith hath once giuen vnto it a ſound beginning of the true being therof, that it is now habituated and incorporated into the minde of the true beleeuer (which is called the firſt act of faith); when (I ſay) we once become to haue the habite of this grace put into vs, and ſoundly planted and ſeated in our hearts: the knowledge of this (if it can be truly diſcerned, and vndoubtedly faſtened vpon), is queſtionleſſe the ſureſt and ſafeſt to truſt vnto, for them that are able to find out ſuch a work thus to be wrought in them: for this worke being once done, is neuer to doe againe, becauſe it cannot be vndone for euer any more; for ſuch grace once truly had, neuer faileth the hauer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, it being a part of the regeneration and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth of a Chriſtian, whereby power is giuen vnto him to become the Sonne of God; now once borne the child of God he remaineth ſo euer, he is no more to bee borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the ſecond time: euen as Baptiſme (the outward Sacrament of the new-birth) is once onely adminiſtred, and ſo is ſufficient for all our whole life time, and is no more reiterated at any time againe. But though this bee the ſureſt, yet becauſe it is the hardeſt to finde out, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by the ſecond act, which is the more liuely and effectuall working of this grace, the ſame is moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and manifeſtly diſcerned and made knowne, to haue a true and liuely being in that ſubiect, wherein ſo effectually it is ſeene to haue that manner of working. Euen as it is a farre readier and eaſier way for one to know in himſelfe, or make manifeſt to another that hee hath life in him, and is indeed a liuing man; by ſpeaking, by walking, by working, and doing the actions of one that is liuing: then by the apprehending the time of his firſt conceiuing or quickening in the wombe; or of his firſt entring into the world when hee was new borne. Therefore it is vſuall in the Scripture for men to bee dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this caſe, to find out and manifeſt their faith by the fruits and workes that it doth bring forth: to diſcerne
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13967:49"/>
the ſureneſſe of their graces, by the effectualneſſe of their operation, and by the ſoundneſſe of all that which is ſeene to come from them: euery man being willed to conſider his owne wayes in his heart, and to looke vpon the workes of his hands, and thereby to giue iudgement how the caſe doth ſtand with him as touching his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which is an eaſie way of triall, and ready courſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to finde out this matter by: for euen a blind man will truly iudge by the effects which hee can ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly feele, the certaine and vndoubted being of ſuch a thing as neceſſarily doth cauſe ſuch effects as he ſo doth feele, though in regard of his blindneſſe he cannot ſee the ſame thing, nor diſcerne where it ſhould bee. As bring him to the fier, and let him feele the heate thereof, he will as certainly apprehend, and as vndoubtedly conclude that there is fier, as thoſe that by ſeeing it, are able by their ſight beſt of all to diſcerne it. And otherwiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a feeling of ſome manner of the working of faith, I thinke it to be moſt rare and difficult for any to finde that he hath faith in himſelf at all. I denie not but faith may haue a being, where the working of it is not felt; but ſo long as the working of it is not felt, I hold that the being of it is not found; and doubtleſſe true and ſauing faith<note place="margin">Faith may be without feeling.</note> hath no ſooner giuen vnto it a true being at all, then it hath alſo giuen vnto it ſome kind of acting and working together with the being at the very ſame time, though not alwayes ſeene. For it is a liuing and a liuely faith, and not a dead faith, which muſt be a ſauing faith: now in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing that hath the being of it in life, there is an act of liuing in that thing that hath ſuch a being: and as the Apoſtle ſaith, that workes are to faith, as is the ſpirit and<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 26.</note> breath of life to the body: and concludeth thereupon, that as the body without the ſpirit is dead; ſo faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome kind of working and operation, is dead alſo. It is true a body may haue life remaining in it, though the ſpirit and breath of life cannot be ſeene nor perceiued to haue any ſtirring or motion at all in the ſame; but then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13967:50"/>
that remaining of life, and being in this world in ſuch a body, is neither found nor felt by it ſelfe, but in ſuch an exſtaſie ſeemeth to it ſelfe to be as in another world; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is iudged by others that looke vpon it, to bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then if it were truly dead, and had no life at all in it: and yet for all this ſuch a partie hauing his life ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in him, may recouer and get ſtrength againe. Thus may it fare with ſauing faith in the heart of a true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, it may haue ſuch weakneſſe come vpon it, ſuch faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and feeblenes may ouertake it, it may fall into ſuch an exſtacie, and into ſuch qualmes and ſwoundings away, that ſhall ſo ſtint the ſenſible working thereof, as no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the life of it, by any working that can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to come from it, may either be felt by the hauer, or any way diſcerned by the beholder that ſtandeth &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a weak Chriſtian ſo fallen &amp; fainted away; and yet for al that, true faith is alwaies liuing faith, hauing euer the truth of life, and being remaining in it, though many times with much fainting, yet neuer wholly failing for altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But if I may be ſo bold as to leade you on a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this digreſſion from your former ſpeech, before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to it againe; I demand (if it be poſſible, that it may fare thus with ſauing faith in the heart of a true beleeuer, that it may remaine in life and being, when there can be perceiued no manner of operation and working to come from the ſame), how that will ſtand true which you affirmed before, that faith hath no ſooner giuen vnto it to haue life and being, then it is alſo in hand with ſome kind of action and working, which doe neuer ceaſe ſo long as that remaines to be: for what kind of working can you ſhew faith to be in hand withall then, when it is in ſuch a caſe, as laſtly was mentioned and ſet downe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Euen the worke of liuing, as I ſaid before, it is in hand with the continuing of the act of life, till life it ſelfe ſhall ceaſe to be (for life ſo long as it laſteth, is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued act of that that ſo hath life in it), and beſides by this meanes of the liuing of it that is in hand, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13967:50"/>
moſt bleſſed and happie worke of the preſeruation<note place="margin">Weakeſt faith ſaueth.</note> of the ſoule in which it liueth, that it may keepe that ſafe from periſhing for euer, ſo long as that may haue any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding and remaining in the ſame. The liuing and being of pretious faith, how weakly ſo euer, it doth liue in the heart of a true beleeuer, ſtandeth that ſoule in as great ſtead (ſo long as it abideth in it) as doth the ſpirit of life, or the liuely ſpirit ſtand the body in ſtead ſo long as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth and abideth in the ſame: which being that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den claſpe which handfaſteth the ſoule with the body, keepeth the body from being a dead carkaſe; and is as ſalt to keepe the body ſweete (ſo long as it abideth in it) from ſtinking, rotting and corrupting, which quickly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would doe, if it were once diſſolued and gone from out of the ſame. So doth true and ſauing faith, which is the golden button and claſpe of our ſoules, that claſpeth and handfaſteth vs vnto Chriſt, and will neuer let goe the hold that it hath of him, till he hath taken vs to himſelfe, and ſet vs ſafe in his kingdome, paſt all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture of more miſcarrying. So long as this faith liueth and hath any being, it aſſuredly preſerueth that ſoule, in which it ſo liueth, from all poſſibilitie of euer periſhing; yea though it ſhould abide in the heart of a true beleeuer in all ſuch weakneſſe, as before was ſpoken of, vntill the very time of the diſſolution of the ſoule and the body; and that a true beleeuer ſhould dye in all that weakneſſe and feeblenes of his faith: yet were it not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſuch a beleeuer could miſcarrie, becauſe he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Chriſt his faith, holding him faſt in Chriſt, and holding Chriſt faſt to him; faith being of that nature that hauing once taken hold of Chriſt, in the greateſt weakneſſe that can come vpon it, it neuer letteth goe the hold it hath taken (though being benummed for a time by ſome diſeaſe of tentation, it may not feele the hold it truly hath), till that ſoule be ſaued that once hath enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, and had it abiding and dwelling therein; it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in death, till it ſeeth that ſoule that ſo hath it to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13967:51"/>
be put into life. And to ſhew yet further, how mightie and powerfull this grace is to ſaue euery one that doth truly beleeue, it dealeth with vs and for vs towards Chriſt in the office that it hath to ſaue vs by Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelfe dealeth for vs towards God his Father, in being our Mediatour, that wee might be brought to God by him. Now we know he neuer will giue ouer the office of his Mediatourſhip for vs, till hauing finiſhed all things for the perfecting of the worke of our full ſaluation, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe and ſubduing all the enemies that wee haue vnto the very laſt of them all which is death; drawing vp all his members euen to the laſt and to the leaſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his body, himſelfe being the head, that all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be glorified with him; and then ſhall be the end of this his office of Mediatourſhip in the manner as now he doth execute the ſame, and neuer till then: when the kingdome ſhall be deliuered vp euen to God the Father, and he himſelfe as Mediatour become ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 24. 28.</note> him that put all things vnder him, that God may be all in all: we being inſeparably ioyned to him, and vnto God by him, that ſo we may raigne for euer in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. After ſome ſuch manner doth pretious faith, which is the faith of Gods elect, diſcharge the office aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned vnto it. Chriſt is the only Sauiour of mankinde, <hi>there is no name giuen vnder heauen whereby wee can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I find, that the moſt generall courſe in the Scriptures throughout, taken by the Spirit of God himſelfe (who is onely wiſe, and ſearcheth the heart and the reynes, and knoweth all men throughly both behind and before, within them and without them, what they are in moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act manner, ſo as nothing can eſcape his knowledge), when he would make the hid things of mans heart mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,<note place="margin">Vſuall triall of faith is by life, not heart.</note> and would make men either knowne to themſelues, or manifeſt them what they are vnto others, or would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome them himſelfe, and conuince them to be ſuch, as he doth challenge them for, and charge them to be, what time he doth enter into plea with them, or hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any controuerſie againſt them; that then his courſe is to put this more vpon the triall of ſuch mens liues, then vpon the diſpoſition of their hearts; more to ſtand vpon what is ſeene to come from them, then to ſtand arguing the caſe, whether it bee true that they ſay they haue, or haue not this or that vertue or vice within them. Like as it will alſo be the courſe, that the righteous Iudge of the whole world will take in that great aſſize (according as himſelfe in part hath made it knowne afore-hand vnto

Now if any thinke he can doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and without workes get his faith, to which he truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be manifeſted and made knowne to bee God; hee calles him forth to doe his beſt, in ſhewing how that can bee performed: ſhew me (ſaith hee) thy faith without<note place="margin">Iames 2. 18.</note> works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes. Which he ſo ſpeaketh, not that any can poſſibly do it, but that their folly may the rather be laid open, and the more diſcouered that ſo doe thinke it. They bee the workes which come from faith, that muſt both ſhew faith, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it to be true. Faith is operatiue, and worketh by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13967:53"/>
loue: if any will find out faith, let him ſeeke after the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> of his loue to God, and to his Saints. If any would know whether hee bee elect or no to eternall life, let him gather the knowledge thereof from the effectualneſſe of his calling and ſanctification of his life: for by theſe <hi>Pc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> leadeth the Chriſtians as by the hand to the finding it<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Q. <hi>But may not faith as well bee found out by the cauſes which cauſeth faith, as by the effects which faith worketh and bringeth forth.

And therefore he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably cheare vp his heart (as did the Apoſtle) againſt euery obiect of feare or diſcomfort, that might ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at any time to diſmay him, and ſay with him, I am not aſhamed, neither doe I paſſe at all for this, <hi>for I</hi>

The faith of euery one commeth not to grow vp ſo ſpeedily, and to attaine to that ripeneſſe of the ſudden, as they that haue it can haue ſuch preſent refreſhing by it, and the like benefit to ſhelter and ſhaddow themſelues vnder the comfortable couering and ſhaddow thereof, in the feruent aking and fainting of their hearts, as had <hi>Ionah</hi>

But though ſome may haue comfort of their faith at the firſt, and for ſome good time together, yet is it as poſſible for that courſe to be interrupted againe, and they as much depriued of that comfortable working of their faith, for the cheering and refreſhing of their hearts afterwards for a time, through the ſtrength of ſome ſore tentation aſſailing the ſame; as <hi>Ionah</hi> was depriued of the benefit of his Gourd for altogether, that refreſhed him ſo well with the ſhadow thereof, when once God had prepared a worme to ſmite that gourd, ſo as it periſhed in one night againe, and became then more diſtreſſed then at the firſt; in ſo much that his heart fainted in him, which made him wiſh in himſelfe now to die, and no longer to liue. So fareth it with many who haue once been ſwet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſhed with the conſolations of Gods, and haue

Then are they more troubled, then if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before knowne what comfort had meant: like <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah,</hi>

Then begin they to call all things into queſtion, which before they found ſo great comfort in, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion is doubted of, either neuer to haue been ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought, or elſe that that which was once happily begun, now to be vntimely brought to an end, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vndone againe.

good my former aſſertion, then in that, and the like vnto<note place="margin">Faith neuer loſt.</note> it which you haue now produced, to make it be doubted of and called into queſtion whether it ſhould be ſo or not. For that thoſe in whom pretious faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vnto life haue been euer ſoundly wrought, and the worke of regeneration in any meaſure hath once been truly begun: that ſuch (I ſay) being ſo in the ſtate of grace, are ſure neuer quite to fall from God, for any thing that afterwards can happen; and that ſuch ſauing graces can neither totally nor finally be loſt of them that haue once receiued them. Wee may ſee it true by the examples of thoſe againſt whom Satan hath bent all his force, and laid as it were his cannon ſhot; endeuouring (if it had bin poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) to haue ouerthrowne them: as of <hi>Dauid, Salomon, Peter,</hi> and ſuch other men, who haue been in the greateſt danger that way, in whom their faith and life of grace haue ſeemed in a manner to haue been quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: partly by ſecuritie, partly by the ſtrength of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherewith they were ſorely aſſailed: and yet wee know theſe were the Lords Worthies, whom no power of the enemie was euer able to preuaile againſt, or finally to ouercome, and their graces, though much eclipſed for a time, yet gloriouſly recouering themſelues againe, and ſhining out with a more perfect brightneſſe in ſome of them, then euer before was ſeene.

you brought in of the failing of <hi>Dauids</hi> graces, there was neuer any <hi>totall abolition</hi> of ſuch graces in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> when hee was ſo fallen, but a <hi>ſoporation onely,</hi> and a ſpirituall ſlumber that came vpon them (as one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> ſpeaketh): his faith indeed ſeemed to faile him for a time, and the comfort of his hope for a while to haue bin gone: but this was neither conceiued nor vttered of him out of any mature deliberation, or ſtaied and ſetled iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when hee was well aduiſed with himſelfe what to determine; but out of a haſtie infirmitie, when ſtrength of tentation had ouerſet him; for hee profeſſed, hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 22. and 116. 11.</note> thus, did but ſpeake it in his haſte. And that <hi>Dauid</hi> being a worthy Prophet, and a man of great and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowledge, and of a ſound iudgement in the truth; yet in his heauineſſe did pray that God would not caſt him out of his preſence, nor take his holy ſpirit from him: this ſhewed a diſeaſed minde to be then in him, and a heart much diſtempered through his great diſtreſſe. So hard a thing is it for a man to keep himſelfe ſound, no not in the chiefe points and principles of religion, in times of ſore affliction and ſtrong tentation. For trouble and griefe will ſorely ſhatter a man: when a mans eyes are full of teares, it is no marueile if hee be found to miſſe euen in reading his owne pardon. Wee know the Lord had ſworne by his holineſſe, that hee would neuer faile <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi> and his mercies beſtowed vpon him were called the ſure mercies of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and though <hi>Dauid</hi> might feare in his weakneſſe, yet God had made a faithfull promiſe that he would not take his ſpirit from <hi>Dauid,</hi> as hee had taken him away from him that was before him. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then this point, as wine failed euen in that banquet<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 3.</note> at which Chriſt himſelfe was preſent; ſo comfort is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times interrupted in that heart in which Chriſt himſelfe dwelleth: and as in the one he turned water into wine in the end; ſo in the other he will turne all ſorrow into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ioy and peace at the laſt. The comforts then of the godly are euerlaſting, the ſtate of grace they ſtand in is

               <p>Q. <hi>If all this be ſo which you haue ſpoken and ſet downe touching true faith, which is the faith of Gods Elect (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as for mine owne part I ſee no great reaſon to make any further doubt therein): namely, that true faith, whenſoeuer it is wrought and planted in a mans heart, it neuer faileth to ſaue euery ſoule that hath it: and that the leaſt meaſure of ſauing faith, is as true faith as is the greateſt. And that true faith being once had, howſoeuer it may be winnowed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed, yet can it neuer be afterward loſt; till that ſoule be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that euer truly had it, and was poſſeſſed thereof.

                  <hi>of the ſame, that man knoweth not the price therof: Gold ſhall not be giuen for it, neither ſhall ſiluer be waighed for the price therof.

whether he be in the faith or no: ſetting euery one a worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſearching and finding out the true being of faith in them, vnder no leſſe penalty and damage, then is the loſſe of all their comfort of their being in Chriſt, and of the whole claime they doe make vnto ſaluation by him; and of their abiding other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in no better eſtate then in the ſtate of plaine reprobates, that are ſure to be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is moſt true that you ſay this grace of faith is of an inualuable worth; it is the very hindge, vpon which the gate of heauen turnes, which openeth it ſelfe to giue entrance to euery one that hath it; but alwayes ſtands ſhut, keeping them out that come without it. Worthily therefore did the Apoſtle enioyne this vnto vs, to giue all diligence to make ſure worke about our faith, proouing and examining our ſelues how the caſe ſtandeth with vs, touching the matter of our faith and true beleeuing; for he knew full well, that faith (of all other the graces of Gods ſpirit) is a grace moſt neceſſary to bee had of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that deſireth to be ſaued, and that it is well worth the looking after, and labouring for, if happily with all our labour, our looking, and our ſeeking, it may be found and light vpon: for it is a pearle of that price that who ſo is a wiſe Merchant, will ſell all that euer he hath to purchaſe and to get it. It is a find-all, and a Iewell of that worth and value, as who ſo knoweth it, will neuer giue ouer ſeeking till he hath found it; for he that findeth it, is made for euer by it: in finding it, he findeth life, and is ſure for euer to be ſaued by it. Such may reioyce indeede with the ioy of Gods people, and glory with Gods inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; yea, they may reioyce and triumph for euermore: and not onely themfelues, but call in others of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to reioyce together with them, and praiſe God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for his mercy this way ſhewed vnto them, vpon more waighty and iuſt occaſion, then did that woman men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the parable in the Goſpell; who lighting a<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 8. 9.</note> candle, and ſweeping her houſe, and finding her Groat, called in her neighbours to reioyce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with her, becauſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13967:59"/>
that her Groat that was loſt before, was now found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Neither is it more comfortable then it is poſſible to haue this effected; that by prouing we may finde that we haue true faith, and ſo by conſequent come to haue aſſurance of being ſaued; otherwiſe ſhould we neuer be<note place="margin">Faith may be knowne.</note> commanded thus to endeauour to goe about to doe it; for howſoeuer vnder the law precepts were giuen of things that were impoſſible, that wee might know our owne weakneſſe: yet vnder the Goſpell precepts are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of things though hard to be done, yet of things that poſſibly may be done, and well may bee attained vnto, that the power of Chriſt his grace may thereby be made the more manifeſt, and the better to appeare: as when we are commanded to beleue and to prooue and to try our ſelues whither wee truly doe beleeue. But though it be true that faith by ſearching may be felt, and found out; being once vndoubtedly had, that it cannot finally and for euer be loſt againe: yet it is as true that through the default of the hauer, neglecting to vſe the meanes to haue it goe well with his faith, whereby the vigour of it, and liuely operation and working of the ſame may be ſhewed forth: the comfortable feeling of the preſence of faith may be ſo loſt to ſuch a man: and through his no better<note place="margin">Feeling may be loſt.</note> looking to it, nor looking after it; ſo may faith it ſelfe be to ſeeke, as if neither were at all, nor neuer had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch a heart; neither will the comfort of it be had againe, nor faith it ſelfe be euer light vpon and diſcerned to haue any reſidence or certaine being there, tillby a long labour of ſeeking, looking, ranſacking, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the roomes and corners of the heart, all the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and carriages of the life, hauing alſo the light of beſt direction out of the word of God lighted vp vnto vs for our furtherance herein; the ſame may happily at length be diſcerned where it is remaining, and to haue (though in weake manner) yet ſtill a true being; which may ſeeme in ſome ſort to be exemplified by this phraſe and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking thus vſed by the Apoſtle, willing vs to

                  <hi>A.</hi> I will not be vnwilling to do the beſt I can herein, and plainly to ſhew what I thinke concerning either of them.

And theſe two differences and contrary qualities, doe alwaies keepe the fences ſeuerall betweene them, as howſoeuer there may be a very neere neighbour-hood betweene them, a bordering and an abutting of the one hard by the other, yet can they neuer commune toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the one be ſuffered to come within the other, by meanes of this ſtrong fence and partition wall, that from the firſt to the laſt runneth throughout betweene them, euermore to keepe them aſunder.

Pet. 1. 7.</note> ſelfe in the end to be more precious then gold that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth; and redoundeth to the greater praiſe, honour and glory of the true beleeuer. On the contrary, falſhood may for a time be couered and masked vnder the viſour and vaile of truth; but at the length time will cauſe it to be diſcerned, for it is full of crackes and rents on euery ſide, which can neuer be ſo made vp; but the diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof will thereby breake out at the laſt, and eaſily be diſcried. For truth pierceth through falſhood on euery part, which oppoſing it ſelfe to ſound ſincerity, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſimplicity; is found to melt away as ſnow doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sunne. Falſe and fained faith may indeed ſhew goodly and flouriſhing faire for a time; it may ſhine out with ſuch a luſtre and gliſtering brightnes, as may ſeeme to dazle the eyes of all that are the beholders of it, as though it were among other vertues, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> is among other ſtarres; which comming next before the Sunne, is filled full of light, and brighteth the day before him; when in the end, for all ſuch ſhining, time will make it appeare to be no better then the light that commeth but from rotten wood, which when it is once diſcerned, euery one doth contemne as a thing of no worth, but to be ſpurned away, and to be troden vnder his feet. In like manner all the light of ioy and comfort which ſeemed to be giuen out from that faith which is not ſound, will at the length be put in obſcure darkneſſe, the heart being left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all manner of cheere and comfort, both hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ioy leſſe, when times of triall and of ſore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 21.</note> doe happen to to come: as our Sauiour ſheweth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly in the parable, and daily experience alſo witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be moſt true. Neither doth the vnſoundneſſe and and falſeneſſe of faith onely appeare at the end, when once the end of it is come, ſhewing it to haue beene but temporarie which did not long endure: but before the end be come, euen when it is in the prime of the chiefeſt working, if it be wel obſerued, there is a cleere difference

So this goodly and glorious imaginarie dead ceremoniall and ſeeming faith, which thus may be ſeene to haue all the parts and lineaments of the well proportioned body of true and liuely faith, it may well be ſaid to haue indeed the ſhape and image of ſauing faith, but yet all this while it is no better then a dead image, wanting the <hi>ſoule</hi> of faith, and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of life that ſhould breath in it, euen the <hi>ſpirit of ſanctification and holineſſe</hi> to inſpire theſe common graces, as parts and lineaments of this image and body with <hi>holie motion,</hi> and life of ſanctifying grace, which might deriue holineſſe and puritie ſo into euery part, for the ſeaſoning and ſanctifying of all, that all might be made pleaſing and acceptable vnto God by the ſame.

               <p>Their knowledge is ſwimming in the braine, in an idle and bare ſpeculation only.</p>

               <p>They keepe the word of God in their eares to heare it, and in their tongues to talke of it: they get knowledge out of the word of God to tip their tongues with fine and eloquent ſpeech, and to diſpute learnedly about points that are intricate.</p>

               <p>5 There is great difference betweene the knowledge of theſe two, in reſpect of the kinds of their knowledge: which are very diuers.</p>

               <p>Theſe haue a much more cleare, diſtinct, ſpeciall, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, and experimentall knowledge, their minds being ſo inlightned by the Spirit of God, with the knowledge of God out of his Word, as thereupon they are <hi>transformed</hi>

               <p>The apprehenſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by an hypocrite in his owne imagination, is but as the holding of an Angell of gold in the hand of one, that is deceiued by a <hi>Iuggler,</hi> that hath his ſenſes preſtigiated by the cunning working of the diuell: ſuch a one is made to beleeue he hath that he hath not; the Iuggler in ſhew, and to his ſeeming, puts an Angell into his hand, bids him ſhut his hand, and hold it faſt; the man now thinks hee hath it ſure, but when hee openeth his hand to take out his piece of gold, hee either findes nothing there; or if any thing at all, nothing better then a ſlippe, a piece of copper, or a counter that will goe for no payment, and ſo finds
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13967:74"/>
himſelfe to be neuer the better for it, nor neuer the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, but meerely couſoned and deluded by a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
               <p>There is a hiſtory related (if the matter be not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) of an <hi>Apoſtatate profeſſor,</hi> who comming to the <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord</hi> to receiue the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> when hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the <hi>bread</hi> into his hand, it became turned into <hi>aſhes</hi> by and by. Which (if it were ſo) did plainly enough ſhew that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would feede no ſuch; but as hee had withdrawne his heart from Chriſt, ſo Chriſt could well enough withdraw himſelfe from him, that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer apprehend him, and haue no part in him: the diuell made ſuch a one beleeue, and his owne falſe heart begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him as well as did the diuell, cauſing him to thinke, that if he could come to the <hi>Lords table</hi> and partake in the Sacrament, he ſhould receiue <hi>Chriſt</hi> well enough: as it is the conceit of the moſt to this day, who neuer do goe further; but he found by lamentable experience, that the deceiuer had beguiled him: for, opening his hand for bread to put into his mouth, there was nothing but aſhes found, and ſo nothing to eate; hee might ſtarue well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for any nouriſhment that was there to be had.</p>
               <p>Though all hypocrites in comming to the Sacrament, there to apprehend Chriſt, and to receiue (as they vſe to ſpeake) their Maker, haue not alwaies ſuch a viſible ſigne put into their hands of receiuing nothing, as had <hi>this back-ſlider;</hi> yet let them looke into their hearts, and there they ſhall find (if they be wel ranſacked and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) as true nothing to be there; no preſence of Chriſt, of his fleſh, and his blood, for their ſpirituall nouriſhment; as that man had no bread remaining but aſhes in ſtead of bread for him to feede vpon: <hi>a lye being in their right</hi>

                  <hi>hand through a ſeduced heart beguiling them,</hi> as ſpeaketh the Prophet. And ſo their caſe paralelleth the caſe of that man, whoſe ſenſes the couſoning Iugler by Satans ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull working had ſo preſtigiated, as he was made to beleeue he had a piece of gold put into his hands, but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13967:75"/>
when he looked to take it out, there hee found nothing, but all was gonne. In like manner theſe, with thoſe of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who were profeſſors as well as the beſt, and<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 17.</note> thought they had their part in Chriſt as plentifully as who had moſt: that thought they were rich enough and wanted nothing; when in the meane time they knew not that <hi>they were wretched, miſerable, poore, blind, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, wanting all things;</hi> till the matter at length came to be tried, and then it was proued to be ſo indeed: ſo theſe thinke they haue laid good hold of Chriſt, and are ſo ſurely poſſeſſed of him, as there is no feare at all of their euer periſhing for their being out of him. But when tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhall bee made thereof at the day of iudgement, or at the houre of death, when they ſhall begin to cry, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> vnto Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, maſter, now helpe and ſaue vs!</hi> he will then ſtand aloofe off, and make the matter very ſtrange vnto them, as though hee had neuer knowne them. Then ſhall it appeare that there was neuer any ſound nor true acquaintance betweene Chriſt and them; they neuer in Chriſt, becauſe they were not new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Chriſt neuer in them; and therefore they will be found to be no better then plaine reprobates.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But of ſuch profeſſors comming to the Sacrament there to receiue Chriſt, and to be partakers of him, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay they receiue nothing, for they receiue the holy ſignes and ſeales of Chriſt his body and blood, ſtamped with the true and vncounterfait impreſſion of Gods owne Ordinance and inſtitution, to make them more reuerend in our eyes and eſtimation: yea they are ſtiled and named by the inſtitutor and ordainer of himſelfe: not the ſignes and ſeales of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood, but they are called his body and blood, that wee</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> True, and ſo it proueth to be to the <hi>worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> who bringeth with him as well a <hi>ſpirituall hand of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13967:75"/>
faith,</hi> to receiue and lay hold of the <hi>thing</hi> that is <hi>ſignified,</hi> as a <hi>bodily hand of fleſh</hi> to receiue the <hi>outward ſigne</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and bringeth as well the <hi>veſſell of his heart</hi> purged and made cleane for the fleſh and blood of Chriſt to bee put into, for the ſpirituall nouriſhing of him to eternall life, as his <hi>mouth</hi> is prepared, and readily opened to receiue the bread and wine for the bodily nouriſhing of this temporarie life. And for all that hypocrites and misbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in receiuing the Sacrament, either receiue nothing, or that which to them is as good as nothing, if it bee not worſe, making themſelues thereby <hi>guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſo receiuing their owne damnation,</hi> but Chriſt to ſaluation I am ſure they doe not receiue, neither at all apprehend to haue him to be theirs. They may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, as <hi>Iudas</hi> is ſaid to receiue <hi>panem domini,</hi> but not <hi>panem dominum;</hi> the <hi>bread of the Lord, but not the bread which is the Lord.</hi> The Word and Sacraments by Gods ordinance are as Chriſts veſtments and garments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is couered, vnto which the true beleeuers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, taking them, and touching them with the hand of faith, they reach further then to the outward garment and couering, touching Chriſt himſelfe, and taking hold of him; and ſo with the woman in the Goſpell, <hi>they draw</hi>

                  <hi>vertue out of him for their healing.</hi> But vnbeleeuers that want this true faith, they can catch hold of nothing but the bare garments, and outward couerings alone, they comming to ſeeke Chriſt there, find him no more there preſent vnto them, then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> found Chriſt in the ſepulchre when they went to ſeeke him after hee was<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 5. 6. 7.</note> riſen; they found indeed the linnen clothes in which hee was wrapped, but him they found not, for hee was riſen and gone from thence. They find in the Sacraments the outward elements of Chriſts outward veſtments and garments he vſeth to be clothed withall; but him they ſhall be ſure neuer to find comming in that faſhion to ſeeke him; no, though they ſhould goe after him with their <hi>bullockes, goates and offerings,</hi> ſo ſeeking his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:13967:76"/>
, and to get a countenance at his hands, the Lord ſo iuſtly requiting them, that as they like hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites draw neare to them with their <hi>lippes onely,</hi> their <hi>hearts in the meane time being remoued farre from him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 13.</note> ſo he will be ſeene to take no pleaſure in them, not to be found of them, when they doe ſeeke him, or to ſhew at all any countenance vnto them: according to that, <hi>If any man withdraw himſelfe, my ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in</hi>

                  <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed I cannot denie they haue receiued the Lords holy Sacraments, of God his owne inſtitution, and that they are not a little proud on; they thinke they are well enough for that day, and it may be for that yeere, till that day twelue-moneth come againe: they thinke, hauing admittance from the Miniſter, and gotten the Sacrament once into their hands; they haue wealth enough, and are rich enough to defray all charges, and to pay all debts, that either God their <hi>Creditor,</hi> or the diuell their <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> can burthen them withall; for Chriſt (they make rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning) ſhall now anſwere for all; they make no doubt they haue receiued him when they receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo hauing had him, they ſtill hold him faſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if this were ſo, that opening their hands of faith, they might ſee him there held faſt, and opening the doore of their hearts, they could find him truly preſent, and there dwelling in their hearts by that faith, then were they rich indeed, both to pay all that were owing, and to liue of that which remained beſide. But in ſtead of this Angell of gold, that which they haue, proueth to be no better then a very ſlip or counter, which they tooke in ſtead of good gold or ſiluer, which will goe for no payment, that will buy them no bread, nor pay any pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie debt; they may ſtarue for hunger for any thing that with that they can buy at Gods hands: they may be caſt into priſon, and there lie till they rot, for any ſhortening of their debt they owe vnto God with making ſuch pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for theſe to pleade before God, the receiuing of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13967:76"/>
his Sacraments, will be ſo farre from cleering of the debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke, as it will runne them further into arerages with him, and bring them deeper into his danger: nothing is for them to bee hoped for, that this way can bee got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>But now on the other ſide, a true Chriſtian that is ſound in the faith, doth by his faith ſo truly apprehend Chriſt, that <hi>hee hath reall and true vnion and communion</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Such are to labour by iudgement, to conuince and controle their abuſed ſenſe and feeling, who ſometimes<note place="margin">Want of feeling.</note> to their owne ſenſe and feeling, may thinke God to haue forſaken them; <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> to haue quite left them, and to be departed and gone from them; when as yet he is ſtill
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13967:84"/>
where he was, and as touching his fauour and his loue, vnalterable, remaining ſtill the ſame towards them that he was; the alteration being found onely to bee in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by reaſon of the ſtrong tentations that are vpon them. Men are therefore not to meaſure their eſtate by ſenſe and feeling: for many times in naturall things, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is able to controle our ſenſe, as if I being in a ſhip that is driuen with a faire wind and tide, doe ſaile by a Tower or Caſtle ſtanding vpon a banke, when I looke vpon the Tower, as the ſhip doth ſwiftly paſſe by, my ſenſe of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thinketh that the Tower goeth away, while I my ſelfe ſtand ſtill in the ſhip: but my iudgement and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding telleth me, that it is otherwiſe in truth, and that the Tower ſtandeth ſtill and moueth not, but it is I and the ſhip that doe goe away from it, though to my ſenſe of ſeeing it ſeemes otherwiſe to be. In like manner as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, feeling, a man that hath but raging paine in one tooth, or hath but a fellon on the vttermoſt ioynt of his finger, or the paine of the goute onely in his toe; though all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be ſound and in good health beſides, he feeleth more the paine of that one little member of his tooth, or of his toe, then the ſound health of his whole body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, though the health of the whole body be much more, then is the paine of that one member. In like manner doth it many times fall out with good Chriſtians, if they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and inriched with neuer ſo many good graces of Gods Spirit, hauing true <hi>faith,</hi> and ioyned therewith <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godlineſſe, brotherly kindneſſe, charitie, hope, humility meekeneſſe, repentance,</hi> and the reſt that are linkes of that golden chaine, wherewith the vertues are chained and linked one to another, if it ſhould happen not to be well with them in any one of the ſaid graces (according as theſe ſeueral graces of the mind, as well as the ſeuerall members of the body, may bee put out of their right frame, and haue diſtemper and diſeaſe bred in them, and brought vpon them), though in the meane while it were neuer ſo well with them in all the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13967:84"/>
reſt, yet is it found vſuall for them more to feele the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of the diſtemper, and hurt of ſome one of theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo out of frame, then to feele the content and comfort of the abiding in good eſtate of all the reſt beſide; and to bee more grieued with the diſeaſe that is growne vpon that one, then ioyed with the health that doth ſtil remaine in all the other. As if a good man being ſore prouoked and ſet vpon of the ſudden, ſhould be ſo much diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and put out of all patience, as he ſhould breake forth to much fury and rage in his haſtie anger (which is no better then a ſhort madneſſe), and being come to his right mind againe, his fit being once ouer (for all that while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelfe), he ſhould then bethinke himſelfe what he had done: ſo would he bee out of conceit with himſelfe, he would be ſo caſt downe in his owne eyes, ſo ſmitten in heart, ſo pricked in conſcience, ſo wounded in his ſoule with griefe for his ſinne, he would crie out and complaine for being thus ouerſeene, as that the diſtemper of that one grace of patience, and the weakenes thereof, which could then beare no more, would more bee felt of him with griefe, and work him greater woe, and diſquiet him much more, then he ſhould feele comfort, or haue contentment in the good eſtate which all the reſt did abide in beſide, and yet that one ſlip of his for a time is not ſo blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, as is commendable the ordinary courſe of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conſtantly held on in the well-vſing and practiſing of other his graces: wherein much ſoundneſſe is found ſtil to be remaining.</p>
               <p>And as among the members and parts of the body, ſome are more neceſſarie then are others, and ſo more hardly can be ſpared; ſome are more dangerous to take hurt in, or for any diſeaſe to breed vpon them, becauſe they are the vitall parts of the body, ſuch as is the heart, the liuer and the braine, which if they ſhould be periſhed, the life it ſelfe would be loſt: when ſuch parts are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, men are found to be more troubled about the hearts of ſuch, and the diſeaſes bred vpon them, then vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13967:85"/>
ther the partes of their bodies beſides, they are moſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious and doubtfull of the recouering of them aboue, that they are of all the reſt, euer fearing leſt thoſe hurts ſhould not be well healed, or thoſe diſeaſes ſoundly cured and recpiered againe. As if one ſhould haue among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the outward parts and members of his body, his right hand ſo maimed, as it ſhould be in daunger to bee quite cut off, and ſo loſt; and of all the inward parts ſhould haue a diſeaſe breeding in him, that ſhould dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly affect the heart, which being a moſt vitall part, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the very fountaine and ſeate of life, that doth ſend forth the vitall ſpirits, and life it ſelfe to the other parts, if that ſhould be periſhed, then the very life it ſelfe would vetterly be loſt.</p>
               <p>Much after this manner is it found to be with good Chriſtians, in reſpect of the differing graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they haue receiued from God, though all verie vſefull for the Chriſtian life, yet ſome are more abſolutely needfull, as being vnto the ſoule, not onely the hand by which it worketh: but as the heart which is the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle and ſeate of life, by which it liueth, which if they ſhould miſcarry, all would be loſt, ſuch as is faith, and loue and repentance vnto life. If theſe ſhould receiue any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous hurt, or fall into any deadly diſeaſe, whereof they ſhould not be againe well recouered, there muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the vtter ruine of ſuch a Chriſtian. When therefore their faith is mightily aſſailed, and by the ſtrength of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſorely ſhaken: when their repentance is challenged not to be ſound, and ſuch as it ought; Oh, then how ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous is a carefull Chriſtian, about the hauing of theſe well cured and recouered againe? how feareful and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is he, leſt theſe ſhould faile him, and neuer be holpen? how doth hee enquire after the beſt Phyſitians, to heare the beſt counſell that in this caſe may be giuen? yea, if a whole Colledge of Phyſitians ſhould all meete together to conferre about his diſeaſe, they all would ſcarce bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to giue him ſatisfying that his diſeaſe were curable,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13967:85"/>
and might well bee holpen; he would doubt, that all the Balme in the Lords <hi>Gilead</hi> would not ſuffice to make for him a remedy, that ſhould bee ſoueraigue and ſauing enough; nor that all they together, ſhould haue ſufficient skill how to apply it, ſo as hee might haue good recouerie thereby. Yea, if it once grow ill with them in their faith and repentance, and that theſe graces are ſmitten at, ſtroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and wounded by ſome ſoare and dangerous tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then in ſtead of complaining of the weakeneſſe and hurt of their faith and repentance, they fall to entertaine a conceit into their mindes, which troubleth them worſe then did all the reſt; namely, that they haue no faith at all, that they haue no true repentance, nor euer yet had. But I would demand, if they had not ſome remainder of the life of theſe graces of faith and repentance, by which they feele the wounds and hurts, that theſe affected members and parts of the inner man haue receiued? how come they to make complaint in particular, about their faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that it is not well with them? Can a man that hath his leggs cut off, ſo hauing no legs, be affected with the aching, or painefull dolour of the wounds and hurts which are in his legs? he may complaine of paines in other partes, but griefes in his leggs he can neither feele nor complaine of, for he hath none at all to be pained in. But if a man hauing indeed a leg that is now hurt and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then were it meere ſolly and madneſſe for him to complaine and ſay, that he hath no leg, becauſe his leg is ſo maimed and hurt, for that proueth that he hath a leg, in that he complaineth, all his paine is in his leg, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines not of his arme, nor of his head, which both may be well for all that.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>True: but may not a man complaine he hath no legs at all, if his legs indeed be once cut off?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But I demand againe: Can a man in like manner<note place="margin">Of feeling.</note> complaine that hee hath no heart at all, if his heart bee plucked out? We know that then he is but a dead man: for the heart is the moſt vitall part of the body, and the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13967:86"/>
very ſeate of life, which being principally in it, the life it ſelfe by it is communicated to all the reſt: deſtroy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and pluck out the heart, and then tell me what life will be remaining in that body for it to complaine it hath no heart? Faith is as vitall a part for the life of the ſoule, as the heart is for the life of the body: for it is the only organe and receptacle of all the life of the ſoule, that it receiueth from Chriſt the onely fountaine of true life, and by it that ſpirituall life which is receiued from Chriſt is communicated to euery power and part of the ſoule beſide. It is the very ſoule of our ſoule: for wee liue by faith, wee walke and worke by it, and not by ſight: the life of faith is that which doth animate all other vertues beſide that are in vs. Plucke this faith away and deſtroy faith which is the life of the ſoule, and then what life will there be remaining in that ſoule, for a man to feele by it that he hath no faith? or to complaine of the weakneſſe and wants of his faith? for then he ſhould be as a dead man that ſhould haue no feeling in him; as <hi>vnbeleevers and wicked perſons are ſaid to be dead, euen while they liue;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 6. Iude 12.</note> 
                  <hi>yea twice dead and pluckt vp by the rootes, and are paſt fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. Nay, the complaining by weake Chriſtians about their faith for the weakneſſe thereof, or for the want of their faith, argueth the preſence and being in life of their faith, by which they haue ſuch feeling and make ſuch complaining; as one complaining that he feeleth paine at his heart, that doth argue that he hath a heart, and that his heart is in life which maketh him ſo to complaine.</p>
               <p>Theſe are not vnlike vnto that <hi>melancholike</hi> perſon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Treatiſe of Me lacholy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pa.</hi> 215</note> who being ouer borne and ouerſet with that dangerous humour of melancholy, complained he had no head, nor could not poſſibly be otherwiſe perſwaded, then by that courſe which that prudent Phyſition <hi>Phylotimus</hi> did take with him when he cauſed to be made a cap of lead very waightie and heauie, and the ſame to be put vpon his head, that feeling the weight thereof vpon his head, hee
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13967:86"/>
might be brought to conceiue otherwiſe, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that hee had a head. And as they are not much vnlike that <hi>melancholike</hi> for kinde of diſeaſe, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with melancholie conceits, to thinke that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that which indeed hee had; ſo doe I thinke the like kinde of remedie in this caſe not vnfit to be vſed for their cure, which was vſed for his. I would therefore lay vpon theſe weake Chriſtians no other burthen, but the weight of their owne burthen, of holy ſorrow and griefe and doubtfull deſpaire for their wanting of faith (as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe deeme), which is ſo weightie, as they are like to ſinke vnder it, &amp; wholly to be broken down with the load thereof, yet that being laid vpon the head of their faith, they may bee asked whether they feele any ſuch burthen, and are preſſed vnder the heauie weight of the ſame? which if they do, let them neuer make doubt more but that they haue faith, and their faith hath both head and hart too, that hath life in it, which moueth that ſenſe, and cauſeth that feeling, and worketh that holie griefe and ſorrow ſo to complaine, the whole ſoule being quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened thereby throughout, and all the graces of Gods ſpirit that are therein. There is no life of ſpirituall graces otherwiſe to be had, then as the ſame be deriued from Chriſt, who is our life and the fountaine thereof: there is no paſſage for this life to flow into our ſoules, but as by faith the ſame be let in, which only is the inſtrument of the vnion that is betweene Chriſt and vs, and the proper hand to receiue all grace from him: the very receptacle, and (as I may ſay) the ciſterne to hold the grace it hath receiued from him as out of the fountaine, and ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute it to all the reſt of the graces that are in that ſoule wherein it is ſeated.</p>
               <p>If therefore there be any liuely feeling of our want of faith and mourning for our want; if we complaine of the want of faith, feeling it to be a burthen vnto vs that is too heauie for vs to beare: if wee ſigh and groane vnder that burthen, with earneſt longings and daily prayers to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13967:87"/>
be eaſed, and with ſuch deſires of obtaining that which we want, as willingly we neglect no meanes that we can know, is to be vſed for our better comming by it: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there is the preſence of holy grace (for ſuch a true deſire of grace in the want of grace is grace it ſelfe) and there is the euidence of the life of grace manifeſtly to be ſeene. Now that life of grace cannot otherwiſe be had but as from faith, and by meanes thereof it be receiued, which drawing life from Chriſt, and taking it from him doth repleniſh the whole ſoule therewith, and quickneth euery grace with the ſame that is found therein. So that ſuch a liuely feeling of the want of faith, and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that want, with deſire of hauing that want ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, doe no other in truth but argue the preſence of liuely faith, howſoeuer it be not felt.</p>
               <p>Faith as well may be preſent in the ſoule, though it be not felt, and though hauing it we be not for a time priuie<note place="margin">Feeling.</note> to our ſo hauing of it, as Chriſt himſelfe may be preſent with a true Chriſtian, when yet being ſtrongly ſet vpon by ſome ſore tentation, hee may thinke himſelfe for the time, wholly to be giuen ouer and to be quite forſaken.

yet they themſelues ſhall not be aware of his ſo being: as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpake of Gods preſence with him at Bethel, <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was here, and I was not aware. The Lord can tell</hi> (ſaith one of the ancient Fathers) <hi>how to be wholly euery</hi>

We muſt know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and beleeue, God can doe ſome things which wee can neuer finde out the manner and the way by which they are ſo done. And in ſuch things, the greateſt reaſon of the doing of them is, the only power and might of him by whom they are done.</hi> There are two waies after which the Lord may be ſaid to be with his children, while they remaine in this world: one, which may bee perceiued and well may bee felt: another, which is ſecret and cannot bee knowne but by the euent and effect, as they by proofe finde themſelues to haue been ſuſtained and vpheld in all their greateſt troubles, though they know not how, and could not then perceiue by whom; but it was the Lord that ſuſtained them with the one hand, while hee was putting them downe with the other.</p>
               <p>After ſuch a manner may faith be knowne to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the heart, when yet it cannot ſenſibly bee felt: namely, as it may be followed, diſcouered, and found out by the working. It is well worth the obſeruing, that it is promiſed in the Goſpell, that whoſoeuer beleeueth ſhall<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 16.</note> neuer periſh, but haue life euerlaſting.

that is, he whom God (who onely knoweth the hearts of all, and knoweth them better then wee know them our ſelues) knoweth that hee doth truly, though neuer ſo weakely, beleeue; and who hath faith in Gods account, though it be not ſo in his owne, though he haue not the feeling of his faith, nor the comfort of his owne belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, nor can no more apprehend how the Lord can in any fauour be preſent with him, then could <hi>Gideon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how that could be ſo which the Angell ſpake vnto<note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 12. 13.</note> him, telling him that the Lord was with him (they being in the meane while oppreſſed by the hands of the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites), yet that man is vndoubtedly in the ſtate of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch a one can neuer periſh in the end.

This they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon to be all that can be taught them, there is no more to be learned: they know al are to be ſaued only by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, what need they any more? they are now ſure of their ſaluation for euer, they will neuer doubt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

The Lord ſeeth well enough that the things we eaſily come by, wee vſe as little care for and as lightly to ſet by. Neither doth the Lord vſe to giue this to be had all at once, and wholly to be wrought vp of the ſudden. It is not a plant of <hi>a nights growing,</hi> as was <hi>Ionahs gourd:</hi> for when it is once growne and come to perfection, it is neither the bittereſt nor ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereſt froſt of one nights freezing, nor all the ſharpeſt winters of a mans whole life beſide, nor the bitings of all wormes that ſhall lie nibling at the roote, that euer can ſo poſſibly bite it or ſinite it, as wholly for altogether to ouerthrow it in the end.

into ſuch a fooles paradice, as now to thinke no mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to be better then his owne, and that therefore none may bee merrier then hee may be, nor any haue better or greater ioy, then he may haue; ſo that this his ioy being but home-bred, is no better then a carnall ioy, and a fruite of the fleſh. And as it is fetched no higher then from himſelfe: ſo doth it reach no higher then to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for beyond himſelfe vpward, it truly and properly cannot be ſaid to go; it mounteth not ſo high, as to reach vnto God aboue, as vnto the moſt worthy and principall obiect, that it can find to ſettle vpon, and to ſolace it ſelfe and take delight in. Such a one ſeemeth to haue a delight indeede, and take ſome great pleaſure in the fauour of God, which hee ſtandeth perſwaded he now abideth in, and which he holds (by miſapplying of promiſes, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking of grounds) without all controuerſie to belong vnto him. Thoſe fauours of God (how ſlightly, ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or wtongfully ſoeuer they be laid hold vpon) hee can well enough ioy in, when once they are deſcended, and come downe ſo low, as they are found to light vpon him (as he conceiues), that now he may ſeeme to touch them, and take hold of them, reckoning without all faile to bee ſaued by them as well, and as ſoone as the beſt. Neither need any to marueile, though they are ſeene to haue ſuch a ioy; for what reprobate is there that is ſo fooliſh, that would not with that fooliſh prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi> that was more blind and brutiſh, then the dumbe Aſſe he rode vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; be ioyfull and glad, if he knew he might bee ſaued at the laſt, and ſhare with the righteous in his latter end? this differeth not much from the pleaſure, delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, which a very bruite beaſt may haue: the Hogge which hunteth after nothing more, then to get his raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous appetite ſatisfied, ſeemeth to bee glad when hee can get vnder an Acorn tree, greedily gathering vp the Acorns that fali from the tree, and neuer leaues eating, till he hath eaten his fill, it is the fruit onely that he ioyes in; as for the tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he neither cares for, nor any whit doth looke after.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:13967:102"/>
Much after this manner is the ioying of theſe kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers; they ioy in Gods fauours ſo farre, as they may any benefit by them, but God himſelfe they little care for, neither doe they ſo much delight themſelues in him; if ſaluation might fall to their lot, they would leape and be glad, but to haue the Lord himſelfe their portion, that doe they not ſo greatly deſire, nor ſo much reckon vpon. The faith, the loue, the feare and ioy of ſuch ſore of men, and all whatſoeuer elſe they doe, proceede but of corrupt ſelfe loue, whereby they loue their owne welfare, their preſent and future good eſtate; they deſire Gods fauour, and they ioy in conceiting that they ſhall haue it, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for it ſelfe, but in a by-reſpect, either to <hi>eſcape ſome</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſired fauour to haue the plague gone; or to obtaine ſome <hi>greater good,</hi> as <hi>Balaam</hi> that wiſhed hee might be ſaued; and <hi>Eſau</hi> as prophane as he was, could yet deſire to bee <hi>bleſſed.</hi> They pretend the loue of God, when yet they loue him not for himſelfe, but in reſpect of his benefits; as <hi>Saul</hi> loued God for a Kingdome.

This ſinne will liue, when other ſinnes ſhall die, and will raiſe it ſelfe vp out of the ruines of them all, which is more to be feared among vertues, then found among other vices; it is the verie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of vertue, and as a ſpreading cankar or gangrene, hauing once gotten to bee faſtned vpon the body of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it neuer leaueth (vnleſſe it be the more timely cured) till going from ioynt to ioynt, it hath weakened and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne that whole body, how beautifull ſoeuer it were

otherwiſe and goodly to looke vpon. This is the greateſt enemy to vertue that it hath, as that which hath vertue euer in chaſe, and ſtill is dogging it at the heeles. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle himſelf after his high aduancement, and abundance of reuelations giuen him, when he had been wrapt vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third heauens, was not exempt from the perill ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, nor from the danger of the hot purſuit and aſſailement thereof, as which was ready to ſet vpon him, if helpe and aide the ſooner had not been ſent; <hi>the meſſenger of Satan</hi> therefore was faine to bee ſped out apace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſtand <hi>Paul</hi> herein in ſome ſtead, <hi>who fell to beating and buffeting of him,</hi>

And ſo by one enemie he was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen out of the hands of another enemy, euery way as bad as hee. Though Satan ſending his meſſenger, aimed at nothing leſſe, then at ſuch an end: but God that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-powreth Satan, and ouer-ruleth in all things, would haue it ſo come to paſſe. But what is the cure of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of pride? ſurely as pride ſpoileth vertue, ſo vice ſpoileth pride againe. And as out of the aſhes of other ſinnes, pride is ſaid to ſpring vp; ſo out of the flouriſhing againe of other ſinnes, all that pride is plucked downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And this may bee thought to bee one cauſe, why the Lord ſeeth it meete, not wholly to free his ſeruants from many infirmities, and much corruption of nature which is found ſtill remaining in them; namely, that as he would not caſt out all the enemies of his people out of that good land, to which he had brought them, leſt the wild beaſtes for want of their helpe ſhould preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: ſo doth the Lord ſuffer that ſtrength of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to remaine in his children, that they may be aided thereby againſt all the aſſailings of pride, which is ſuch a wild beaſt as otherwiſe could not well bee with-ſtood, but were likely otherwiſe to deuoure all vertue that it could find in them, and by ſo doing, come finally to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13967:117"/>
them. Satan therefore that is ſo buſie with Gods children to bee euer tempting them to ſinne, and to one ſinne after another, doth therein but worke againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and doth but lay a traine to blow vp the caſtles of pride, wherein himſelfe ſhould moſt ſtrongly and ſafely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. And while he neuer leaueth, till he haue drawne the childe of God at the laſt to commit ſome great and hainous ſinne which proueth to be as a wakening ſinne vnto him, who before was ſlumbring in ſecuritie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him to ſtart vp and ariſe out of his ſleepe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his waies in his heart to humble himſelfe at once, and to repent for that, and for all his ſinnes beſide. Now Satan in this doing, doth but pull (as we vſe to ſay) an old houſe vpon his head, for he pulleth downe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth thereby the whole frame of all the other ſinnes which hee had built vp, and got to be planted in that mans heart before, and ſo by his reſtleſſe tentations, he deſtroyeth and croſſeth his owne worke, the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him in deſpight of his teeth, to worke againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who though he doe what he can, yet will the Lord euer be found to ouerſhoote Satan, euen in his own bowe. In all which reſpects, the Lord (through his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, goodneſſe, and mercy) ſo ordering euery thing, as he maketh the very ſinnes of his ſeruants committed by them, not a little to turne to the good of themſelues, by cauſing them therby the better to know their owne frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and what ſtrength of corruption is ſtill abiding in them, that ſo they may be drawne to a greater humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more earneſt repenting not alone for their laſt ſinnes, but for ſuch ſinnes alſo as before, either were not knowne, or neuer at al ſoundly repented on, and withal to haue a far greater care bred in them, how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more warily for afterwards, euermore with feare and trembling working on their owne ſaluation. And when beſides Gods ſeruants ſhall ſee the workes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan thus diſtolued in them, that what he intended for their ouerthrow, doth now ſerue for their furtherance, and to

their making for euer, the diuels poyſon being ſo altered and changed by the ouer-ruling hand, as it becommeth medicine, Satan tempting and drawing them to ſinne, and the Lord by that ſinne pulling them out of more ſinne, ſo curing ſinne by ſinne. And laſtly, and chiefly when they at the length doth ſee, how the Lord doth out of the ſinnes committed by them (how odious and abominable ſoeuer they haue been which they haue done), make way for his owne greater glory, and the more magnifying of the riches of thoſe his mercies, whereby both the ſame, their ſinnes are pardoned vnto them, and they themſelues in like manner cleared and purged from the venemous infection, and ſtrong corruption of them; what ſhould let, but that (which being euer humbled in themſelues with godly ſorrow for their ſinnes, and going out of themſelues), yet the true ſeruants of God (their ſinnes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) may reioyce in the Lord, and alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in him, for the excellency of all this worke thus wrought by him?</p>

Howbeit, in reſpect of another worke which the Lord himſelfe is then in hand with, euen when his ſeruant is ſinning; or after hee hath ſinned, found ſtill abiding in that ſinne he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (if that worke of God could be well ſeene into, and rightly and wiſely diſcerned), I ſee nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but there might be found the like cauſe of reioycing therein, as the ſicke patient findeth cauſe to reioyce in the worke, which he ſeeth his skilfull Phyſitian to be in hand with, when he is tempering the potion, mixing the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, preparing the medicine, and then doth adminiſter it vnto him, and ſets it a working; the patient cannot all this time reioyce, as hauing ſeene and felt what is the good effect of that medicine, nor in perceiuing the cure to be fully wrought, and finiſhed vpon him: but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Phyſitian, who hath taken him in hand, is both skilfull and faithfull, hee reioyceth to ſee him to bee about the worke, and ſo diligent therein, as to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the medicine within his beſt vnderſtanding, hee knoweth of all others to bee moſt fit for his curing. So when the Lord ſeeth no other meanes, to be ſo fit for the recouering of ſome dull and dead-hearted ſeruant of his, out of ſome ſinne that he is fallen into, and in which hee ſtill lieth ſlumbring, without any repenting for the ſame, but to leaue him to himſelfe, that the falling into a greater ſinne, may by occaſion of ſo great a fall, be made to awake out of his ſlumber, and be brought to a thorow and ſound repentance for all his ſinnes together: while ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Chriſtian, thus ſicke and diſeaſed, is committing of ſome great and hainous ſinne, the Lord who is his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13967:119"/>
is in hand in the meane while with another worke of his owne, namely, to bee tempering of ſuch a medicine as ſhall not faile to cure him, the Lord taking the poyſon of that ſinne which he is a committing, and making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a moſt ſoueraigne medicine, it being the Lords man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as hath bin ſpoken before, to cure ſinne with ſinne. Now this worke which the Lord is in hand with euen at that time, if it either can be ſeene by himſelfe (which is moſt hard ſo to be ſeene by any for the preſent time), or can be ſhewed him by any other to be ſo a working, hath matter in it ſufficient to beare out a warrantable reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for that the Lord is a doing, though otherwiſe there is moſt iuſt cauſe of deepe ſorrowing, and moſt bitter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation for that which already is done, and is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a doing by his owneſelfe in that thing.</p>

but aboue others, that place is moſt pregnant and cleere for this purpoſe, where the Apoſtle writing to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, ſaith, that being iuſtified by faith, we not onely are at peace with God, but alſo reioyce euen in tribulation,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note> knowing how many waies tribulation bringeth benefit and profit vnto vs, as he there ſheweth the particulars.

To conclude then this point alſo as touching troubles befalling a good Chriſtian, which ſeeme euer to bring with them cauſes enough to hinder their holy reioycing, and not to deſcend to any more perticulars, but to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all troubles together (manifold, and after a ſort infinit and innumerable though they be), and for an ouerplus of ſtore for the making the heape the greater, to put and to ioyne vnto them all other things alſo that may happen and befall to a true Chriſtian during his whole life time, I doubt not but a wiſe and vnderſtanding Chriſtian may be borne out, if hee in ſome one or other reſpect ſhould finde cauſe of ſome ioy in euery thing, and of his holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in the Lord for his moſt gracious and moſt wiſe diſpenſation of all things that any way doe concerne him: My ground and warrant for ſo ſaying is in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable place and ſpeech of the Apoſtle in his writing to the Romanes (which for the great light and comfort in this behalfe that it doth giue foorth, ſhining gloriouſly vnto vs out of the firmament of the Scriptures, ſeemeth among other places of Scripture to be as the morning ſtarre ſhining out of the midſt of a cloud, yea as the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing brightnes of the Sunne it ſelfe, that lighteneth all things when the full and perfect day is come; which to bee but remembred by vs, is as the ſweete ſmell of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, and of the moſt aromaticall ſpices which haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in them to comfort both heart and braine, and which to be ſpoken vnto vs is as the ſweetnes of hony in the mouthes of all men) namely, <hi>we know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle there) <hi>that all things worke together for good to them that</hi>

true Chriſtian, as if they were all ſworne to be true vnto him herein, and were in ſuch perfect league and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, as could not be broken at any time: yea and as if euery thing were ſo willing hereunto, as al might be ſeene preſt ſo chearefully, to beſtow their labour and take paines about this thing, as it were not eaſie to be diſcerned which were found to be formoſt or forwardeſt therein; all things diligently working together, one thing as well as another to worke good to them that doe truly loue God, as if they had all their power and all their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes bent only vpon this, to doe that man good, but had no power nor any manner of inclination at all to doe him the leaſt hurt in any reſpect at all: as the Apoſtle ſpeaking how hee ſtood affected to ſtand for the truth,<note place="margin">2.

comforting and chearing of his heart againe, all of them begin at once to tell him they meant him no manner of hurt, but were all his friends, who were come to doe him what good they could, if one after another ſhould begin to ſpeake vnto him after ſome ſuch manner as this; I ſee you are much diſquieted and diſmaied by our haſtie and vnlooked for manner of comming vnto you at this time, but ſtay your ſelfe and feare you nothing, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no manner of harme by our comming, we are al ſent from your louing father (who hath a ſpeciall care of your welfare, and would that no euill might come vnto you) to the end that we might be with you, beare you compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and ſee to you in this time of your neede, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might hurt you: and as for my part I proteſt and ſweare vnto you by a ſolemne oath, that as I will do you no hurt, ſo will I doe you all the good I can, to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you and all your harmes, for therefore am I ſent, and in token thereof, for your better ſatisfaction and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, loe here I doe vnarme my ſelfe, and deliuer into your hands all my weapons, that ſo you ſhall not need to feare any thing.

His feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling did not ſo much diſtract him before, as boldneſſe and aſſurance would ſettle him in peace, and put courage and comfort into his heart now.

yea, made to exult with reioycing, when once they ſaw all dangers to be eſcaped, and themſelues (not one of them being miſſing among them), brought all ſafe to the ſhoare, and on the other ſide; then did they ſing for ioy of heart, yea, triumphantly reioyce and ſing with timbrels and dances, and at the length they found, that thoſe things<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 20.</note> which before bred, &amp; brought greateſt feare vpon them, ſerued now but to make them farre more ſecure, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they euer were, or in any likelyhood euer could haue been, if this had not happened, which now was done. True it is, that when their mercileſſe enemies the Egyptians (who had ſo tiranouſly oppreſſed them in the houſe of bondage) were now come with bloody minds, to make a full end of their tyrannie, and to perfect their cruelty vpon them, in their vtter and laſt deſtruction, and were now come within ſight of the Iſraelites, it is not otherwiſe to be thought, but the nearer they perceiued them to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the greater was their feare of them: but ſee how all this was ordered by the Lord to make them farre more ſecure. The purpoſe of the Lord doubtleſſe was with his owne hand, to doe execution vpon the enemies of his people, and to take full vengeance vpon the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, vpon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt, in deſtroying them at once for the curſed cruely, they had exerciſed towards the Iſraelites. Now if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had not followed them at all, but had let them depart quietly out of his Countrie for the preſent, yet might they haue afterward been in ſome doubt and feare, leſt for the old grudge hee bare them, he might haue ioyned with other their enemies, and at ſome other time haue againe ſet vpon them; or if the Lord (minding to deſtroy <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his army), ſhould haue done it at ſome other time, or in ſome other place where Iſrael ſhould not haue ſeene it, but onely heard the idings and the newes thereof, the very report might haue much cheared and gladded their hearts indeed, but yet their minds would not ſo abundantly haue been euerie way ſatisfied and ſecured, as when they ſhould ſee all

this done in their very preſence, they ſtanding by, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ſame. The greatneſſe therefore of their feare by the neare approaching of their enemies, who were now at their heeles, made but for their greater quiet, ſafer ſecuritie, and fuller ſatisfaction, that <hi>thoſe enemies who had troubled them ſo long, ſhould hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth neuer trouble them any more;</hi> execution being done vpon them while they did looke on. <hi>Iſrael ſeeing with their owne eyes the Egyptians dead vpon the ſea banke,</hi>

after them, did (though againſt their will) ſerue to helpe them forward in their way, and to further them on to make more ſpeed, that the ſooner they might be ſet out of all danger, and brought where they ſhould need to feare them no more.

The ſecond is, an <hi>extraordinary</hi> and ſpeciall repentance, vpon ſome extraordinary and ſpeciall occaſion, either of obtaining ſome <hi>ſingular bleſſing,</hi> or getting to be either remoued, or kept away ſome <hi>heauie</hi> and <hi>grieuous plague.</hi> This kind of repentance may iuſtly be occaſioned, by a mans falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome <hi>groſſe ſinne,</hi> after he hath been called to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of grace; the riſing againe from which ſinne, is <hi>a ſpeciall repentance:</hi> as <hi>Dauids</hi> riſing againe from his fall was. In the firſt we are <hi>all</hi> to walke, and that wee are to vſe and practice <hi>euery day,</hi> it being no other, then the ſhewing forth of the efficacie and power of the death and the reſurrection of our bleſſed <hi>Sauiour,</hi> in vs that are members of his body, while wee are ſeene daily to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the <hi>mortification</hi> of the fleſh, and <hi>viuification</hi> of the ſpirit: the putting off the <hi>old man,</hi> and the putting on

the <hi>new:</hi> the dying vnto <hi>ſinne,</hi> and liuing vnto <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and the endeauouring <hi>daily</hi> to doe theſe things: for the repentance of the very beſt men is but a daily <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing</hi> that they cannot be <hi>ſorrie enough,</hi> and repent no better: but as we are to walke in the daily practice of this firſt kind of repentance; ſo from ſome of the occaſions of the ſecond, and eſpecially any falling into groſſe ſinnes, we ſhould beſeech the <hi>Lord</hi> to preſerue vs alwayes, if it might be poſſible by any meanes: if it cannot bee but through too much <hi>humaine frailty</hi> we ſhould find occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, not onely to renew our ordinary <hi>daily</hi> repentance, but often to bring into vſe and practice, a <hi>ſpeciall</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary kind of humbling our ſelues before the <hi>Lord,</hi> in a manner of repentance vſed more then ordinary for ſome ſpeciall ſinnes, or ſpeciall occaſions, our owne, or others; then is that courſe to bee carefully taken and vſed, which in the deſcription of true repentance was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſet downe. And ſuch kind of <hi>extraordinary</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in humbling of themſelues vpon extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, is euer like to ſpeed the better at the hands of <hi>God,</hi> and to preuaile more with him, whenſoeuer, and by whomſoeuer it ſhall be performed in his ſight: if they that are ſo humbled, are knowne and found to bee of the number of them which walke and liue in the vſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>daily</hi> humbling themſelues by <hi>ordinary</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for their <hi>daily ſlips,</hi> common frailties and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Whereas if it be otherwiſe done, by others that are not acquainted with the like courſe, and inured thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; the like reckoning cannot be made by them, neither is there the like <hi>hope</hi> for them to expect at Gods hands the like gracious acceptation.</p>
               <p>Hypocrites they haue little to doe with the firſt of theſe two kinds of repentance, they ſcarce know what it meaneth, and are little acquainted with it: it is not their cuſtome nor manner ordinarily to humble themſelues before God, for their daily infirmities and ſinnes, to make conſcience of their waies, as being deſirous to pleaſe God

better, by going about <hi>daily</hi> to reforme their liues: it is well for them if any iudgement and plague doe come, then to be heard howling vpon their beds, and to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelues for corne and wine, though they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell: then it is for them to fall a rending their garments, though they keepe whole their hearts, if guilt of ſome hainous wickedneſſe committed, like thoſe fiery ſerpents in the wilderneſſe, doe ſting and bite their conſcience; then is it time for them to cry and roare out with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and to fall a repenting with <hi>Iudas,</hi> and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſinne, with like ſatisfaction as was made by him.

               <p>Our ſoules by ſweruing from God, and going out of the path of Gods Commandements, breed their owne ſorrow, and bring painfull griefe and vexation vpon the heart, ſuch as many times hardly can bee endured; like bones that are broken, or out of ioynt, cauſe heauie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours

it, and make it for a time vtterly to faint. <hi>Sinne</hi> will not be <hi>got away</hi> without a great deale of <hi>ſorrow and griefe,</hi> and that of ſuch ſort, as muſt <hi>breake</hi> and <hi>bruiſe</hi> the ſoule, and <hi>grind</hi> the very heart <hi>to duſt</hi> and to powder.

Repentance then cannot be without much ſorrow of heart; where that is, there will be found mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heauineſſe, and great dolour and griefe for ſinne, that hath been committed. And this ſorrowing and mourning is ſo neceſſarie to all ſound repenting, as the latter can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be found, where the former hath wholly beene wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But where ſorrowing and mourning is perceiued, and found to bee for ſome offence that hath been done, there we conclude is a kind of repenting: for when men are ſaid to repent, we vnderſtand by and by, that they are grieued, and are ſorrie for that they haue done; ſo as they would faine, if it were poſſible, haue it vndone againe. And as ſorrow is neceſſarie vnto repentance, ſo it muſt be <hi>very effectuall,</hi> and <hi>thorow ſorrow indeede</hi> that muſt cauſe

If men come from vnder repentance not bruiſed and contrite-hearted, it will profit them nothing. God (I know) commendeth vnto men the preſeruation of their health; but yet hee will not that wee tender ſo our health, that wee may not breake our hearts with ſorrow after God for our ſinne. They that are ſo ſmyrck and ſo ſmug, that being old, haue yet ſo young faces, and ſo few wrinckles vpon them, no paleneſſe or leaneneſſe to bee ſeene, it is to bee thought, that if euer they haue come where true repentance had growne, they would haue loſt ſome of their colour by this time: it is dangerous for men to be ouer-quiet with themſelues after they haue once ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for it is well obſerued, that the way to <hi>draw ſinnes on with cart-ropes</hi> is, <hi>not to be grieued for ſinne;</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing and caſting off <hi>temporall</hi> griefe, is the way to bee brought to <hi>eternall</hi> griefe: they that driue ſorrow away from their hearts, worke their owne ſorrow, and procure to themſelues the greater woe; for afterwards wee ſurely doe know and feele much more earthly ſorrow then wee ſhould, becauſe we will not diſquiet our owne ſoules, nor trouble our ſelues with that godly ſorrow that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Too much merrineſſe (vnleſſe the mirth be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſanctified, ariſing from the ioy and peace of a good conſcience) doth not well.

for the obtaining more <hi>ſweeter comfort</hi> then euer they yet felt, and to haue their ioy now more to abound, then euer before it did, euen ſo to abound vntill it be made full; as our Sauiour hath ſpoken, for they that <hi>mourne thus,</hi> they<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 9.</note> are promiſed <hi>to be comforted;</hi> and ſuch godly ſorrowings as theſe are, doe euer end in contentments, and are turned into the beſt, and the moſt laſting ioyes; yea, there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not <hi>ſome comfort</hi> and ſweetneſſe of ioy in the <hi>midſt</hi> of moſt <hi>bitter mourning,</hi> and greateſt lamentation that is made for ſinne, when the heart is beſt humbled, and moſt broken for the ſame: for men are deceiued if they do not beleeue, that the very <hi>teares</hi> for ſinne be much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to deuout and holy men, then be to wicked men their laughings, mockings, ieſtings and ſcoffings which they delight ſo much in; and if they doe not thinke faſting to be ſweeter to the one, then feaſting is to the other, though they ſhould fare neuer ſo daintily, fed with Plouers, Quailes Pheaſants, and ſuch other coſtly meats, and moſt daintie diſhes.</p>
               <p>Now as there be ſome that cannot abide to bee called to this ſorrowing, and to heare of ſuch mourning for their ſinne, there be others that would ſorrow more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mourne more thorowly, and in farre greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if they knew how: it is the griefe of their hearts that they cannot bee grieued enough, they are ſtill complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the hardnes of their hearts, becauſe they relent no better, &amp; are not more broken aſunder; they complaine of the drineſſe of their eyes, and of the dulneſſe and deadnes of their affections, that are not more moued for their ſinnes, to open themſelues as ſo many freſh ſprings of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row abounding ſo in the heart, that the head might be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with water, and the eyes made a fountaine of teares to weepe day and night, for all their offences and things they haue done amiſſe. They ſigh and are ſorrowfull in their very ſoules, to perceiue what ſoftneſſe and tenderneſſe they find in their hearts, readily to bee moued for any worldly matter, falling out any thing croſſely with them.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13967:149"/>
And on the other ſide, how ſtony and flinty their hearts are felt to be, when they would ſorrow moſt for their ſin, and faineſt get their hearts to melt with greateſt remorſe for the ſame. True it is (as one hath well obſerued it) were it to grieue at earthly occaſions in things wherein we are croſſed in the world, here our affections will come to vs, before we ſent for them, but to ſorrow godly, that is not ſo ready with vs, we haue not our affections at command in that caſe, our fooliſh hearts loue not holy mourning, our hard hearts (till God hath better ſoftned them) are farre from relenting. How beit, let ſuch know this for their comfort, if they doe mourne for the hardneſſe of their hearts, if they bee truly grieued, becauſe they cannot bee better grieued, and deſire yet more to be grieued, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be humbled, there is doubtleſſe comfort and hope in ſuch an eſtate: for what is this but the ſmoake of true repentance, whoſe ſparkes are now new kindled in ſuch a heart; and though the fier thereof hath not yet gotten ſuch ſtrength, as to flame forth with that hot burning and lightſome ſhining as may bee hoped for it will doe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the due time; yet hath our Sauiour promiſed, hee will not for the preſent <hi>quench,</hi> nor ſuffer to be <hi>put out</hi>

Stricken they are, and they know not by whom; they finde not out the cauſe that procures their griefes, which are their ſinnes and wickedneſſe, to get them remoued; and therefore the cauſe not being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, the effect muſt ſtill remaine. They lie ſnared and held faſt by the cordes of their owne iniquities, to thoſe heauie miſeries, plagues and calamities, which God by his righteous and iuſt iudgement doth bring vpon them. And as blinde men in the dark, they ſee no way to eſcape, or how poſſibly to get out, and therefore they muſt needs miſcarrie in it, their ſorrow being but ſorrow vnto death. This kinde of ſorrow is either intended in a high degree, or it is in ſuch a meaſure as may be ſuffered: when it is in an high degree, deſperation is the end of it, making them to lay violent hands vpon themſelues, to become their owne hangmen and executioners to deuoure themſelues. When it is but in a ſmall meaſure, then by little and little it vaniſheth away as it began, and ſoone commeth to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againe; no ſooner the paine ouer, and the affliction gone that did trouble them, but their teares and their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are at an end, and no more to be heard on, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming as bad as euer before, without any amendment to be ſeene, but with the ſwine they turne againe to their
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13967:151"/>
filthie puddle and wallowing in the mire, and with the vncleane dogge they fall to the eating vp againe the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite which they ſpued out before. Such ſorrow bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the heart by changing and turning a man ſo as he become ſoundly conuerted by meanes thereof, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moueth the heart for the preſent with the diuquiet of paine, which onely was the cauſe why it hath been ſo vexed.</p>
               <p>By all this it may appeare how the ſorrow that is in the repentance of a true conuert, is found to be differing from the ſorrow that is in the repentance of an hypocrite; and that is in the obiect that either of them doe reſpect and is occupied about. The ſorrow of him that is truly penitent, is moſt conuerſant and occupied about <hi>malum peccati, The euill of his ſinne,</hi> whereby God hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to be moſt grieued for that.</p>
               <p>The ſorrow of him whoſe repentance is vnſound, is moſt of all occupied about <hi>malum poenae, The euill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> and this (by the marueilous ſlie and ſubtill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Satan, and the vnknowne deceitfulnes of his owne heart) is alwaies and euen then done; when it may be a falſe hearted hypocrite doth both thinke with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and boldly profeſſe to others, that it is his ſinne that he mournes for, and is moſt troubled about: when indeed if the truth were knowne, and could bee ſounded and ſeene into, which lieth ſo deeply buried vnder a maſſe, and (as I may ſay) a mountaine of hollow hypocriſie of ſuch a mans heart, it would be found that it were either feare of ſome further puniſhment, then yet he hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; or ſhame for his ſinne alreadie committed, which hath thus broken out; or loſſe of his credit, or ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and benefit that is like to follow thereof; or elſe the ſenſe of ſome ſtinging iudgement and plague that hee now goeth vnder, and things of the like nature (all which are yet but puniſhments for his ſin) to be the things that he is moſt chiefly moued for. About theſe things he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally is grieued, and that in the firſt place, and for their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:13967:152"/>
owne ſakes, as which he is moſt afraid of, and which hee doth moſt abhorre. He may alſo be grieued for his ſinne,<note place="margin">Falſe ſorrow for ſinne.</note> and wiſh it had neuer been done: but this hee doth in a ſecondary place and in a by reſpect, not ſimply grieuing for the ſinne, and abhorring it therfore becauſe it is ſinne, but becauſe it is like to bring all this woe vpon him, and is the cauſe of the puniſhment that he preſently doth goe vnder. For who knoweth the depths of Satan how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a deceiuer hee is, that can deceiue the falſe-hearted hypocrite himſelfe, that is ſo ordinary a deceiuer of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and cauſe that in a moſt materiall point neceſſary to ſaluation, he ſhall be ouerſeene moſt and ſooneſt deceiue himſelfe? And who knoweth beſides Satans cunning working, how many nookes and crookes, windings and turnings againe is in that labyrinth of an hypocrites hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heart, wherein deceit may cloſely be hid and neuer found out, no not the wrong and wrie reſpects that are in his owne heart, and priuily doe leade and guide him in the actions that himſelfe doe commit; they are not eaſily diſcernable to his owne ſelfe, much leſſe can they be ſhewed by others, which they are, and where they lie, that ſo they may be the better taken heed of. But indeed the maine obiect of the ſorrow of an hypocrite is <hi>malum poenae, the euill of the puniſhment,</hi> with which hee is ſmitten and made ſo to ſmart, that hee cannot reſt in quiet, and that maketh him ſo much to ſorrow and be grieued, which elſe he would not. He may be humbled, but it is rather before his ſickneſſe, with which he is afflicted, then before the Lord, whom he hath offended.</p>

               <p>They differ alſo in that which cauſeth the ſorrow of the one, and of the other; and in that which is cauſed by either.</p>
               <p>That which cauſeth the ſorrow and repentance of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, is more vſually plagues and puniſhments, either inflicted and felt, or threatned and feared when they are imminent, and hang ouer their heads: their hearts reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flint ſtones, which will caſt no ſparkles vnleſſe they be ſtrooke. Rarely will it be found that any of them are brought to bee humbled by the ſole miniſtery of the Word; or if by that, rather by the denouncing of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by the threatnings and thundrings of the Law, then by the ſweet and amiable voice and ſound of the Goſpell, whereout the promiſes of life, and offers of grace are made vnto vs. <hi>Foelix trembled when Paul prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of temperance, and righteouſneſſe, and iudgement to come,</hi> but <hi>Feſtus</hi> mocked when hee heard him preach <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and begin to open the ſecrets and myſteries of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:13967:153"/>
the Goſpell in his hearing; then hee cried out againſt him, that he was <hi>beſide himſelfe,</hi> and that too much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had made him mad. They be not (for the moſt part) words, but blowes and ſtroakes, and thoſe well laid on too by the powerfull hand of a reuenging and irefull Iudge, that will ſerue to maule and breake downe the ſtoutneſſe and ſtubborneſſe of the hearts of proud hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, though ſo well able is the Lord to ſmite the earth with the <hi>rod of his mouth,</hi> and to ſlay the wicked with the <hi>breath of his lippes,</hi> as hee can make his word <hi>quicke and powerfull,</hi> and forcible enough to <hi>pierce deepe,</hi> and <hi>cut ſharper then a two edged ſword,</hi> and out of that qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can draw out ſuch arrowes to ſhoot into the ſides of all hypocrites, as ſhall be ſharpe enough to pierce and to ſplit the hearts of all the Kings enemies, and be able to draw blood out of their ſides, and to fetch ſighes out of their hearts; yea to make them for the time to roare out of their throats for horrour and feare, bee they neuer ſo ſecure, though in the end they become little the better for it. The Lord can make the threatnings of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of his word denounced, come bleake to the hearts of offenders, which ſhall ſend a terrible ſhaking through all their bones, and become as thunder ſtrokes doubled, that are able to daunt the ſtouteſt ſtomack that is: the Lord can make the terrour of the Law, and the thundring out of the threatnings thereof to flaſh as the lightening in euery conſcience that hath guiltineſſe in it, and to be as fier to make their hearts to melt, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe as hard as braſſe. Thus either by the mighty ſtrokes of Gods reuenging hand; inflicting iudgements, plagues, and puniſhments, or by the terrour of the Law, that doth nothing but thunder out threatnings of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, doe the hearts of moſt ſecure hypocrites many times come to bee daunted; yea in a manner ſtrucken dead with horrour and feare, and trembling for the time. And theſe are the things that breed and bring out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that they haue, and cauſeth all their ſorrow to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:13967:153"/>
be ſuch as it is.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the true and godly ſorrow, the ſound and vnfained repentance, the beſt conuerſion of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, that is freeſt from ſuſpition of being counterfeit, is that which is cauſed by the miniſtery of the Word, and by the powerfull working thereof vpon the conſcience: which is as a hammer to breake the ſtonie hardneſſe of the heart, that it may goe all to duſt and powder, and is as fier with the heate thereof to melt the heart, though it were neuer ſo hard frozen in the dregges of ſinne before, as ſhall cauſe ſuch a thaw to bee in that heart, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound of weeping, mourning, and ſhedding teares for ſinnes committed, as if the very ſprings of ſorrow were all opened and looſened, that might cauſe whole ſtreames<note place="margin">The teares and waters of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are as that red ſea, wherein the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of our ſins, which are our moſt dangerous enemies that do purſue vs, are deeply drowned.</note> and brookes of teares to run downe, and flow from the eyes of him that is truly penitent, ſufficient to lay in ſoak the very heart it ſelfe in that abundance of teares; yea, to cleanſe both heart and life, and waſh away all filth of ſin that euer before haue been committed. When ſuch a worke is wrought vpon a mans heart by the miniſterie of the word, and the conſcience feeling it ſelfe wounded and ſtrucken at the hearing thereof, ſhall find no reſt till it hath eaſed it ſelfe by abundant weeping, ſorrowing and mourning that God ſhould euer be ſo offended by him; and vntill direction bee giuen him, what better courſe is now to bee taken, crying out with thoſe true conuerts, and penitent perſons in the Acts, <hi>Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what ſhall we doe that we may be ſaued?</hi> When the word doth thus worke vpon any, without any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of outward croſſe or affliction, that elſe doe happen, it is an excellent good ſigne, and one of the beſt euidences that can bee brought out, of the truth of that ſorrow that hath been bred thereby, and of the ſoundneſſe of that repentance that hath follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed thereof. I denie not but that by croſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions the Lord doth oftentimes recouer and fetch home his ſtray-ſeruants, and reclaime them out of their

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:13967:155"/>
ought principally to be lamented and bewailed by them: I doe alſo acknowledge that the terrour of <hi>Gods Law</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing plagues and puniſhments, and threatnings of vengeance to all that are tranſgreſſors thereof, may ſo ſtrike and aſtoniſh for a time the hearts of Gods hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and deiected ſeruants, as there can bee felt of them no other then a ſeruile and ſlauiſh feare of death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, trembling before the fierceneſſe of Gods wrath, whoſe angry countenance they behold frowning vpon them, and his hand lifted vp, bending the blow at them, which they feare will ſtrike them dead at his feet. Then is their ſorrowing little differing from that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow that cauſeth death: they ſorrowing, becauſe they can ſee no way of eſcaping; but of neceſſity (as they thinke) they muſt haue their portion with the diuell and the damned, in eternall hell fier. But this kind of ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fearing, is not that which they doe euer abide in, nor no longer then the Lord ſeeth it moſt expedien for them, for their better humbling, and then it is taken away againe with that ſpirit of bondage that made them ſo to feare, and their worldly ſorrow becommeth changed into godly ſorrow, that cauſeth in them repentance vnto life; and their ſlauiſh and ſeruile feare, into a ſonne-like and a child-like feare, cauſing them to feare the Lord; not ſo much becauſe of his wrath, as for that there is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with him: with which fearing there is ioyned bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the ſpirit of adoption giuen them, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to feare after that painfull manner no more. <hi>Legall contrition</hi> then is not any <hi>part</hi> or <hi>cauſe</hi> of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Gods children, but onely an occaſion thereof; and that by the meere mercy of God; for it ſelfe is the <hi>ſting of the Law,</hi> and the very entrance into the pit of hell. The Law and the Goſpell, although in ſome ſort they teach one thing, yet they perſwade not by the ſame arguments. The Goſpell perſwadeth by the death of Chriſt, who hath loued vs, and giuen himſelfe for vs, that we might be ſaued by him: this the Law neuer knew,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:13967:155"/>
nor yet taketh knowledge of, but it perſwadeth with <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and feare of iudgement:</hi> but the Goſpell hath a more ſweeter voice, and in a more amiable manner calleth vs to repentance and amendment of life, and our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt</hi> commeth with bleſſing vs, to turne vs from our iniquities.

vexed with griefe and ſorrow in their hearts, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their inward heauineſſe by an outward great hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of themſelues, after the manner that <hi>Ahab</hi> was ſeene to be before the Lord, they grow ſo conceited in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for that they haue done, &amp; do ſo flatter themſelues with a vaine hope that that which was feared, ſhall now neuer come, or that which they felt, ſhall now not tarry long, truſting to the merit of their halting, lame, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way imperfect repentance, wherewith they ſeemed to be humbled: as that <hi>Michah</hi> of Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer promiſed to himſelfe more confidently, though moſt vainly and vnwarrantably, <hi>that God would now doe him</hi>

If they <hi>faſt often,</hi> as did the Phariſie in the Goſpell: <hi>if they wrinkle their faces with weeping, and looke ſowre,</hi> as they then vſed to doe in that time: if <hi>they weepe and howle and roare out vpon their beds: if they afflict their ſoules with faſting, and bow downe their heads like bulruſhes</hi> for a time: they make ſo full recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and preſume ſo largely vpon the merit of that they haue done, as though God were now come to be in their debt, and that they had abundantly deſerued it at the hands of God to haue all things granted, which in ſuch a

manner they ſhould ſeeke to obtaine, and that the Lord ſhould denie nothing, which men ſo humbled after ſuch a faſhion ſhould make ſuite for, and requeſt to haue giuen: yea, they ſeeme to be impatient of any delay to bee made, and that the Lord is not more preſent, looking beſide vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all others, to attend better vpon them: and ſo theſe run a-ſhelfe vpon the ſteep bankes of preſumption, where they once touching, can neuer be ſafely got off againe, till they haue made their graues there, and doe ſinke right downe to the bottome of deepe deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Anorher way by which this worldly ſorrow cauſeth death is, when (there being no meaſure kept in it, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that can be had of it, to keepe it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe that were fit), the ſorrow that is awakened and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp out of the heart that before was ſecure, breaketh out to all extremities in the higheſt degree, there being<note place="margin">No outward balme able to aſſwage a raging conſcience.</note> nothing to ſtay, or ballaſte the heart from being vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed in the ſtreſſe and ſtorme of tentation, when it commeth vpon the conſcience: no light of comfort, no dram of faith can then bee found to giue any ſuccour in time of that wofull diſtreſſe, or to ſupport and hold vp the heart from falling flat downe, and ſinking quite vnder the importable and intolerable loade and burden of ſorrow preſſing hard vpon them: but yeelding ouer (as thoſe that can reſiſt no longer) to the luſt and will of their vowed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, who all the while did but ſeeke oportunitie to worke their vtter ruine, they tarry not til he deſtroy them, but damnably deſtroy themſelues, and deſperately doe take on their courſe to throw off this ſorrow, that ſhortly would otherwiſe of it ſelfe haue here had an end; making haſte by laying violent hands vpon themſelues, to ruſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell at once, and that with ſuch violence, as if by force they would breake open the gates of that gaping gulfe before them, that they might haue the more ſpeedie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance there to grow acquainted with thoſe ſorrowes, that wil neuer haue an end, which can neither be throwne off, nor poſſibly boarne, can neuer bee auoided, nor no

When, though they ſhall neuer find any cauſe to feare any more that that can bee worſe then they doe feele; yet ſhall they feele worſe, and much more then euer they could haue feared: and ſuch feare hauing an end, their feeling ſhall be euerlaſting, of paines that are vnſpeakable, and torments that neuer will haue an end. Thus worldly ſorrow, prooueth helliſh ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the end; and when it is an ouer-deepe ſorrow intended to the vttermoſt and furtheſt degree, it cauſeth death, and death euerlaſting, by ſwallowing men vp in the gulfe of deadly deſpaire, and daſhing them againſt that moſt dangerous rocke, where they ſplit in a thouſand pieces, and wracke wofully to their finall and euerlaſting vndoing, All this may be ſeene in <hi>Saul, Achitophel,</hi> and in that arch-traitor <hi>Iudas,</hi> who hauing been a long while ſecure and dead-hearted, euery way vnreclaimeable from further going on with that miſchiefe hee was in hand with, till he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted it; when once he had done that enormious fact, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hainous ſin of his moſt vnnaturall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie and villany againſt his Lord &amp; Maſter, that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable wickednes, and vnmatchable villany of his, did lye ſo boyling in his conſcience, as made him reſtleſſe, and neuer gaue him ouer, till for want of other eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort elſewhere to bee found, he ſought to get rid out of that trouble, by ſtrangling himſelfe in an halter: and ſo though he ſorrowed as much as ſome other, and repented more then did, or doe many, yet becauſe it was but a ſlub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering ſorrow, and a fruitleſſe and falſe repentance, his helliſh ſorrow drowned him vp in deſpaire, and for all ſuch repentance, he went to hell in the end for his labour.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Odly ſorrow, being the ſorrow of true conuerts, and of vnfained beleeuers, that on the other ſide cauſeth life, for it couſeth true repentance, which is called <hi>repentance vnto life;</hi> and it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not a ſingle and bare kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance alone, but a repentance richly furniſhed with ſuch graces as are moſt fit, and found to bee moſt meete to bee her attendants; and they are reckoned vp by the Apoſtle to bee ſeuen in number, which wee know makes a perfect number, all which are brought forth, and ſet euery one in her place and order, as ſo many <hi>maidens of honour,</hi> to giue their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, to accompany and waite vpon their <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Miſtris,</hi> true and ſauing repentance; which among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other vertues taketh place before them, and ſitteth as a great Princeſſe, and chiefe Lady of honour, whom the reſt are to giue much way vnto, and dulie to attend vpon. Now godly ſorrow marſhalleth in all theſe graces, as which procureth and cauſeth them all, the Apoſtle ſetteth
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13967:158"/>
it out as a very generous grace, and fruitfull vertue, hauing a goodly traine following her, and a very fruitfull off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and generation of other graces that ſpring out of her, and are produced by her.</p>
               <p>The firſt grace mentioned by the Apoſtle, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of godly ſorrow, and is cauſed thereby, is <hi>care;</hi> and that not an ordinarie care, after an ordinarie manner ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but a ſingular and very ſpeciall care euery way nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and remarkeable: as the words vſed by the Apoſtle to ſhew and ſet it forth by, doe plainely import, that it was a care worthy the marking and looking vpon, when hee ſaith, <hi>behold your care;</hi> and not ſimply your care, but what a care; with a new riſe, and as it were a double vye: both words ſhewing, that it was a very great and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie care, that they were now ſeene to haue, after they had once ſorrowed thus godly. So long as men haue not the ſight and knowledge of their ſinnes, and haue not the ſenſe and feeling of their ſorrow and griefe for them, they abide ſecure and careleſſe, and are troubled with nothing: but when their hearts are thorowly once pierced and wounded with ſorrow for them, then they begin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre themſelues, and to looke about them, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to take care for the buſineſſe, how things may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, that are ſo much amiſſe; how they may get out of Satans clouches, of whom they haue been held faſt as priſoners ſo long; and when, as poore priſoners, they haue ſcaped out of the hands of a rough and cruell Iailor, to care and take heede neuer to come into his fingers any more. And ſince by grieuing Gods ſpirit, we haue been thus grieued our ſelues, to haue care to ſhew our ſelues more tractable euer after to follow better his guiding, and the leading of his hand. The word that is vſed, may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>ſtudie, earneſt labour and diligence,</hi> which they vſed to<note place="margin">

                  </note> correct the fault, and take away the ſcandall: it was not an idle thinking, but a deepe weighing and laying mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together, and as it were a beating of their braines with an earneſt ſtudie and care about thoſe things. So
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13967:159"/>
that where godly ſorrow hath been firſt wrought, for offending God by our ſinnes committed, that ſorrow will breede and bring in this caring, this ſtudying and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taking thought about the matters of our ſaluation, how God that hath been ſo offended, may againe be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: how his anger that is kindled, may be quenched and be cauſed to ceaſe: what we are to doe that we may be ſaued: what courſe we may take to pleaſe God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It breeds in vs care to ſhunne all ſuch occaſions, as by which we were drawne to fall into ſinne before, and care to vſe all good meanes, without neglecting any, whereby we may be confirmed in our better ſtanding, and kept from falling for afterward. In whom ſuch a care is not found to be wrought and follow vpon their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for ſinne, their ſorrow is vnſound, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are farre from repenting truly, for they are not come yet to the firſt ſteppe that ſhould leade to the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſecond grace, cauſed by godly ſorrow, was <hi>a clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of themſelues:</hi> and that too, in a notable manner: for of all theſe ſeuerall graces, the Apoſtle vſeth the ſame words, to ſhew they were all very remarkable in them. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>what a care! behold what a cleering!</hi> Giuing all to vnderſtand, that theſe graces were right and of the beſt kinde, and were in a very notable and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree found to be in them. Now the word may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Apologie, or defence of a mans ſelfe, whereby hee may be excuſed. This cleering of themſelues, was rather by a free acknowledging of the fault, confeſſing of the action, asking mercie for it, by ſuing out a pardon to haue it forgiuen, and they that way to be cleered and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when the action is once withdrawne, the contrc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie taken vp, and the ſuite ſo brought to an end: then for them to ſtand vpon poynts with God, in holding plea with him, to make that either nothing or leſſe then it is, made by God himſelfe, in his declaration that hee hath drawne and put in againſt them. If a child hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:13967:159"/>
his father by euill doing, and his father knowing it, ſhall call him to an account for it, it is not for the childe to goe and ſeeke how he may excuſe himſelfe, by laying it vpon ſome others, by telling this or that lye vnto him, for that will but more offend him: but his way is, to downe vpon his knees, to confeſſe plainly the fault, to ſhew his griefe for it, and to craue to haue it forgiuen. This will ſooneſt purchaſe pardon from his father, and ſo being forgiuen, he goeth away cleered of the fault. This cleering, the Apoſtle mentioneth twice in one verſe in the ſame place, and maketh it to be the laſt and bleſſed effect, which all theſe graces (together where they are found to be wrought) will at the length bring foorth in him that truly doth repent: and that is, they will cleere him from all his ſinnes. There is no better cleering to bee got from ſin, then by ſoundly repenting: that will cleere him before God, who harh promiſed to pardon all the ſinnes of ſuch, to <hi>take away all their iniquities,</hi> to <hi>couer their tranſgreſſions,</hi> and <hi>neuer to remember ſuch their ſinnes any more;</hi> in ſuch ſort, as if they ſhould be enquired for, <hi>they ſhould not be found,</hi> and if they ſhould be asked after, <hi>there ſhould be none:</hi> now if <hi>God doe iuſtifie, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Repentance is the beſt way of cleering any ſinner in like manner before men: who if he be once found to haue truly and ſoundly repented indeed, and to haue giuen that ſatisfaction, which in ſome caſes is neceſſary to be giuen: then let his ſinne haue been neuer ſo grieuous, they ought to forgiue it, to cleere him of it, and to vpbraid him no more by the ſame.</p>
               <p>Sound and true repentance is the beſt way of cleering any ſinner, and of defending of him againſt the ſtrongeſt accuſations that ſinne it ſelfe or Satan can lay in againſt him: for though they can iuſtly lay to his charge that he hath done ſuch a ſinne, yet hee can as readily cleere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe from that accuſation, by anſwering that hee hath vnfainedly repented for that ſin, and obtained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:13967:160"/>
for the ſame, which hee hath readie to ſhew for his lawfull diſcharge, againſt all that liſt to challenge him, or call him further into any queſtion. The ſinner that hath truly repented for his ſinne, hath alwaies ſuch an anſwere as this to make vnto Satan, euen when he is moſt troubleſome vnto him: for ſuch ſins as cannot be vndone, he may ſay vnto Satan, Tell me not <hi>what I haue been,</hi> and <hi>what I haue done;</hi> but <hi>what I am,</hi> and <hi>what I doe,</hi> and <hi>what I would doe:</hi> I was a rebellious ſinner, but I haue obtained grace truly to repent and to leaue my ſinne, ſoundly to be conuerted and changed from that I was, and now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new and another man, I am no more what I was, and I would yet be better then I am. There is a double kinde of cleering away ſinne: there is a cleering of the guiltineſſe of ſinne by pardon for the ſame: and a clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring away of the filthineſſe of ſin, by purging and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſinne away. He that hath committed ſinne, as well open before men, as before God, is to ſeeke to cleere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as before God, ſo before men, by free acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame, humbling themſelues for it, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues to haue truly repented of it.</p>
               <p>The third grace, cauſed by godly ſorrow, is <hi>indignation.</hi> This followeth godly ſorrow, that men are ſet in a chafe, and put into a heate with feruent anger and indignation againſt their ſinnes, and themſelues, for committing of them, to make them fret in their mindes, to be at defiance with ſin, and fall out with themſelues for being ſo groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouer ſeene; and as men when they are angrie one with another, they will not ſtick to fall a railing one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo are they ready to giue themſelues hard tearmes, to ſay, What a beaſt was I? what a foole thus to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene? how was I bewitched? I think I was mad, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was mad in raging againſt the poore Church.</hi> Yea how impatient ſuch haue bin with themſelues, hath bin made to appeare by ſome outward geſtures, of <hi>ſmiting their bands on their thigh,</hi> tearing their haire of their head, and from their beards, rending their garments: which<note place="margin">Ezra. 9. 3.</note>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:13967:160"/>
ſheweth they could not keepe quiet with themſelues. And as for their ſinnes, by which they haue offended God, there is nothing ſo deadly hated and abhorred of them, as are they: they can neuer more abide them, their blood riſeth, and their hearts ſwell againſt them where euer they ſee them. Neuer did <hi>Amnon more loath Thamar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 13. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>after he had ſatisfied his filthie luſt with her, when he could not abide her preſence any longer, but commanded ſhe ſhould be thruſt out of the doores, and the doores bolted againſt her that ſhe might come in no more,</hi> inſomuch, as it is ſaid, <hi>the hatred wherewith he then hated her, was greater then the loue was wherewith hee had loued her before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> then theſe true penitent ſeruants of God do loath and abhorre moſt thoſe ſinnes, which before they were knowne to haue loued beſt, ſo as they cared not if they neuer ſaw their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more: and it is an endleſſe vexation and torment to their conſcience but to thinke of them, and of the vile euils that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted with them, ſo as they can haue no reſt, till they haue rid them away out of their ſight, thruſt them out of the doores of their hearts, caſt them out of their hands, as things moſt loathſome that cannot longer be abidden, and in deteſtation of them, bid them <hi>get them hence,</hi> barring vp all paſſages ſo to keepe them out, as there may be no place left open, by which it might be poſſible for them, returning, euer to get any entertaiment there againe. Their angrie carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſinnes that haue deceiued them moſt, is not vnlike the rage of ſome men, when they come once to ſee how they haue been oft abuſed and vndone by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie queanes and harlots that haue enticed them, they then grow impatient, and can no more abide them, they are ready in defiance of them, to ſpit them in the teeth, to ſlit their noſes and giue them whores markes, and ſend them away diſgraced, that none may euer more be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and abuſed by them, but know them what they are. So doe theſe deale with their ſinnes, they doe not only loath them themſelues, to ſpit in their faces, thereby
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13967:161"/>
to ſhew in what degree they doe abhorre them; but they caſt all the ſhame and diſgrace vpon them they can, to make others in like ſort to loathe them, and not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued as they haue been by them; they ſo brand and marke them, that al may be warned to take heed of them, and not to indanger themſelues to bee miſchiefed and ſpoyled by them. This is that which the Prophet ſheweth ſhall be done by the people, when they are once reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of their way of erting, and ſhewed the right way they were to take and walke in; he ſaith, <hi>they ſhould not onely leaue worſhipping of grauen Images, care no more for them, and doe them away:</hi> but ſhew their indignation againſt them, <hi>by defacing them, ſpoiling the couerings of them, teare and rend their golden ornaments, defile that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 30. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>that was about them, and then caſt them all away as a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous cloth,</hi> with words of greateſt abhorring and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſpoken vnto them, when they ſhall ſay vnto them, <hi>Get thee hence.</hi> This is that feruent anger and indignation that is cauſed by godly ſorrow, in the hearts of them that doe truly repent, againſt all their ſinnes which they haue committed, and wherewith God ſo much hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>The fourth grace cauſed by godly ſorrow, in the heart of him that is truly penitent, is <hi>feare,</hi> a grace that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſecuritie, prophaneneſſe, and all contempt of God. This feare, ſo it be vnderſtood of a holy feare, ſuch as may beſeeme a true ſeruant and child of God to haue, may bee carried as farre and as wide as you will, it hath included vnder it all that is to bee feared: for he that is thorowly touched and wounded in his conſcience with godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, cannot abide careleſſe any more, nor remaine voide of much trembling and feare; fearing for that that is paſt, and cannot bee vndone, what miſchiefe and harme may grow thereupon; fearing for that which through the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den corruption of nature may be fallen into and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet worſe then that which hath been done, if grace be not in time begged and ſought of God for preuenting
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:13967:161"/>
the ſame; fearing leſt by this his falling into ſinne, God ſhall now be diſhonoured, his truth ſlandered, the Goſpel diſgraced, the holy profeſſion euil ſpoken of, and brought in contempt: fearing leſt his example in ſinning, ſhould imbolden others vnto euill doing, and ſhould lye as a ſtumbling blocke in the way, to cauſe others to fall; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the weake, grieuing the good, and opening the mouthes of the wicked to blaſpheme: fearing Satans malice, leſt he doe againe aſſaile him, and ſet anew vpon him: fearing his owne frailtie, leſt he ſhould againe bee ouercome: fearing leſt God being diſpleaſed with him, ſhould with-hold his grace from him; and leſt being left to himſelfe, he ſhould let the ſpirit be quenched in him, and the ſparkles of grace die out, that were ſo lately but new lighted and kindled in his heart. There is nothing that he may not in ſome ſort feare of the things that are to be ſhunned, and which he ought to be carefull euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to preuent all that he can; according to that, <hi>A good man feareth alwaies;</hi> and that is the beſt way to cauſe him to depart from euill. Many labour to put away this feare, but then they put away that which ſhould breed their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie, and their beſt ſecuritie in the end: in this doing they lay the raines vpon the necke of their owne luſts, being without feare to bee carried by them which way they take liking; and then they were as good ride vpon a wild colt without a bridle, there being no bridle to keepe men in from ſinning, if the feare of God be not found to be in them: the feare of a wounded conſcience is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they forecaſt all the worſt things to themſelues, and labour to preuent them.</p>
               <p>The fifth grace which godly ſorrow cauſeth in the heart of him that is truly penitent, is deſire; which is a grace contrary to that dulneſſe and dead-heartedneſſe, that ſluggiſh and careleſſe negligence, that is vſually found to be with them that are neuer troubled about the eſtate they abide in; and therefore they ſeldome or neuer are moued with any thing; they haue dead hearts
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:13967:162"/>
and feele nothing; and their deſires after goodneſſe are as dead as their hearts, ſo as they care for nothing. But a poore, grieued, and humbled ſoule, that is ſtrucken and wounded in his conſcience with the guilt of his ſinne, hee is made of deſires, he hath nothing but deſires in him. The Hart that is chaſed, deſireth not more after the water brookes, then his ſoule is a thirſt for God, euen for the liuing God, that he might ſee the light of his countenance lifted vp vpon him, and ſo be receiued into his loue and fauour againe. How doth his ſoule <hi>open it ſelfe in deſire unto God after reconciliation with him, for the obtaining of pardon for his ſinne, and that he might be refreſhed with his mercies right ſoone;</hi> euen <hi>as the thirſtie and dry ground when it is chopt and dry gapeth and riueth for want of raine,</hi> till it may be moſtened and refreſhed with ſhowers from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. What is there more in the longing deſire of his heart for afterward, then to cry out with <hi>Dauid, Oh that my waies might now be made ſo direct, as I might henceforth keepe the Commandements of God alwaies:</hi> and that a new heart might be giuen, and a right ſpirit renewed in him: that he might haue ſtrength to withſtand tentation the next time; and that meaſure of grace giuen him, as by which he might be able to ouercome his chiefeſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, denie himſelfe, bring vnder due obedience the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of his will, and rule better his vnruly affections; that his life may be ſo reformed, as God may be wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Church better ſatisfied, he may haue more peace, and ſound comfort in his heart. Theſe, and the like, are the holy deſires which a godly ſorrow will cauſe in that heart wherein it is once wrought. Such will complaine they cannot pray as others, remember Sermons as others, preuaile againſt their ſinnes as doe others: but they haue deſires to doe all theſe; and ſo they being of the number of them, whoſe deſires are ſtill vnto goodneſſe, and who are euer hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſſe; they therefore are pronounced by Chriſt his owne mouth to be bleſſed, becauſe ſuch (in the end) ſhall vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13967:162"/>
be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>The ſixth grace which godly ſorrow cauſeth in the heart of a true penitent, is zeale; which is ſomwhat more then is deſire; for it is deſire intended and encreaſed. This zeale is occupied either about that which is good, with great and feruent deſire after a moſt earneſt manner for louing of it, and hauing it better practiſed: or about that which is euill, with like deſire to haue it ſhunned and abhorred. It is a moſt earneſt affection of the ſoule, which cannot be kept in, but breaketh through all, and bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe: it is a feruency of ſpirit, ariſing of a mixture of loue and anger, cauſing men, with all earneſtneſſe, to ſtand for the truth, and the maintenance of goodneſſe, piety, Gods worſhip and honour, and all things that may make for the furtherance and aduancement thereof. And on the contrary, ſo to be filled with griefe, diſpleaſure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and holy anger, to ſee God diſhonoured, and the truth wronged, or goodneſſe any way to bee diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: as Gods ſeruants haue not been able to endure theſe things, but their zeale about them hath euen conſumed them: as <hi>Dauid</hi> profeſſed, that <hi>his zeale had euen conſumed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 139. 136.</note>

                  <hi>with heauineſſe for his ſinne,</hi> where he thinketh how God hath been diſhonoured by him, what euill he hath done by the ſinne he hath fallen into. How doe his eyes guſh out with riuers of teares, when he conſidereth of theſe things? his zeale compelleth him ſo to doe, hee can doe no otherwiſe. And as he is thus troubled about his owne ſinne, ſuch is his zealous hating of ſinne whereſoeuer hee findes it committed and done, as his ſoule within him, is <hi>vexed</hi> and tormented; as was <hi>Lots</hi> from day to day, in ſeeing and hearing mens outrage in wickedneſſe, and all the abominable and filthy words and deeds of vngodly men; on the other ſide, how is the heart of ſuch a one inflamed with the loue and zeale of the glory of God,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:13967:163"/>
what a burning deſire hath he, that as God hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by him through his falling into ſinne, ſo hee might now bring ſome glory to his name, by his riſing againe from the ſame, and by doing of things worthy of amendment of life, labouring to keepe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, with zeale as hot as fier? what an earneſt care hath he ouer the good of his brethren, leſt any of them ſhould be hurt by his example in ſinning? how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is he found to be in his true zeale to God, and loue to ſo many as he that way hath wronged, to make them the beſt mends he is able, and to giue them any ſatisfaction? he ſtands not vpon his credit among men, how that may be hindred, neither cares hee for worldly ſhame, ſo hee may be ſure God may be honoured and well pleaſed by him. He hath burning in his breaſt ſuch a fier of ardent zeale, as ſoone will conſume all ſuch traſhie counſell, if any ſuch ſhould be giuen, ſo to let and hinder him, and bring it ſo to nothing, that as nothing it would be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth and laſt grace mentioned by the Apoſtle, which godly ſorrow cauſeth in the heart of him that is truly penitent for his ſinne, is reuenge. All the other things being done, it doth not yet content a true penitent perſon; he will not forgiue himſelfe, though God ſhould forgiue him: he would not ſpare his ſin himſelfe, though God ſhould ſpare him for it, and neuer at all be found to ſmite him. The reaſon why he is thus implacable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeaſable towards his ſinne, is, for that he knoweth hee hath not the like enemie in all the world beſide (no not excepting the very diuell of hell himſelfe, with all his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious working) that poſſibly could doe him the like hurt and miſchiefe, as his ſinne alone, either hath, or might haue done: which ſo long as it is ſpared by vs, and no execution ſeene to be done vpon it, that ſinne is all the while in hand with doing that againſt vs, as may become our vtter vndoing: for enough is done by it, ſo long as it is contained and maintained, as may caſt vs out of Gods
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:13967:163"/>
fauour for altogether, and cauſe the Lord to take no more delight nor pleaſure in vs, but to hide his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to withdraw the loue of his heart, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from vs; yea, to incenſe his anger, and cauſe the fier of his wrath to flame out vpon vs: enough is done by it, to ſet Gods Angels and men againſt vs; yea, the diuels of hell alſo, and all other the creatures with them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miniſters of God his vengeance, to doe execution vpon vs, becauſe we haue not done execution vpon our ſinnes, that they might not haue ſtirred vp ſuch diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and wrath againſt vs. What child would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of ſuch a miſchieuous and ſpitefull enemie, as is neuer ceaſing to ſet his father againſt him, ſo as hee can haue no countenance at his fathers hands when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth before him, but is the cauſe why the father looketh with a moſt irefull countenance vpon his ſonne, and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer frowning and bending his brow vpon him, in ſuch ſort as is intollerable, and cannot be abidden; yea, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vpon the point of diſclaiming him to bee his ſonne, and ſo for altogether to diſ-inherit him? All which is done by ſinne againſt euery party offending. Who could euer endure the miſchieuous working of ſuch a ſpitefull enemie and malitious make-bate, as will be ſure to worke a mans vnquiet at home, and ſee that hee ſhall haue no long peace nor reſt abroad, but is euer running to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, often to the Councell, to haue him vp to the Starre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; yea preferring to the King himſelfe many and grieuous complaints againſt him, for which, warrants are ſtill out for him, to fetch him <hi>coram,</hi> that he can neuer reſt nor abide in quiet by him; if ſuch an enemie could be knowne, would not a man bee prouoked rather to die vpon him, then not to bee reuenged on him to the full? But ſuch a deſpitefull enemie haue we of ſinne, which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all that it can againſt vs, it being the greateſt make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate that is in all the world, putting vs to more trouble, then doe all the enemies we haue beſide. It is the onely cauſe wee can haue no peace nor reſt in our conſciences
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:13967:164"/>
at home, becauſe it euer leaues there a ſting of guiltineſſe behind it, which neuer ceaſeth to torment vs. It breedes vs al the trouble, the moleſtation and the griefe, which we at any time doe meet withall abroad; that is euer crying in the eares of the Lord againſt vs, the cries thereof ſtill going vp to heauen. Whence it commeth, that wrath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes goes out from God, and then whole armies of ſorrowfull troubles, afflictions, croſſes, loſſes, ſickneſſes, paines, diſeaſes, and death it ſelfe, are ſent out againſt vs, and come vpon vs, as miniſters of his vengeance, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſuch iuſtice as is meet for ſuch offenders. Will any one then maruell, that a true penitent perſon that hath been much humbled, and whoſe ſoule hath thorowly ſmarted for his ſinne, ſhould carry ſuch an vnappeaſable hatred againſt it, and be at ſuch deadly fewd therewith, as nothing can turne, nor ſtay him from taking vengeance to the full vpon the ſame, ſeeing by reuenging his ſinne himſelfe, he knoweth he ſhall ſpare God a labour, who<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 31.</note> then will bee reuenged thereof no more. Therefore is it that you ſhall ſee true penitent perſons take the whip and rod into their owne hands, and whip their ſinnes ſtarke naked; not after a Popiſh faſhion, with opinion of meriting for the ſame: but after a child-like faſhion, that mourneth before his father, whom he hath wronged and wounded when hee knew not what hee did, as one that was for a time beſide himſelfe, and looking vpon him whom he hath ſo pierced: and being in bitterneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, catcheth hold vpon the inſtruments and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons by which all the miſchiefe hath been done, and then throweth them as farre from him as poſſibly he can, that he may neuer ſee them more. Thus doth a poore grieued ſoule (that is euer mourning before God for the offence that he hath done againſt him), flie vpon the face of his ſinne, and rending his heart with griefe within, and tearing his garments for ſorrow without, ſetting his hand vpon his ſinne, wrecketh all his anger vpon the ſame, tearing it into a thouſand pieces, and rending it all
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:13967:164"/>
to fitters: pulling out his right eyes, cutting off his right hands, martyring the whole body of ſinne, and maiming all the members of the old man; till that as his ſinnes haue crucified Chriſt, hee may ſee them alſo crucified, and to haue breathed out their laſt life breath. A notable example of zeale in taking vengeance vpon ſinne, and of ſeeing execution to be done vpon the ſame, and that to the full, we haue in <hi>Moſes the man of God, who otherwiſe was the meekeſt man vpon earth:</hi> this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> when he was <hi>come downe from the Mount, and ſaw the Calfe they had made, and their dancing about it;</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>his anger first waxed hote, and he cast the Tables out of his hand and brake them beneath the Mount:</hi> and then <hi>be tooke the Calfe which they had made, and burnt it in the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 32. 19. 20. 26. 27. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>fier, and ground it to powder, and ſtrowed it vpon the water, and made the children of Iſrael to drinke it;</hi> that if they would haue it againe, they might no more plucke it off their eares, but goe and rake it out of their bowels. All which was done for the greater deteſtation of their ſinne, and of that their vnſufferable abomination, which hee thus found to haue been erected and ſet vp by them. And yet not ſatisfied herewith, hee called the ſonnes of <hi>Leui</hi> to him, and commanded them, euery man to put his ſword by his ſide, and to goe in and out from gate to gate throughout the campe, and ſlay eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his brother, euery man his companion, euery man his ſonne, and euery man his neighbour, vntill there was vengeance taken of three thouſand men, which fell that day by the ſword. So ſeuere was the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance that was taken, and the execution that was done, both vpon the ſinne committed, and the ſinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that had done it. And this is the furtheſt that a poore grieued and troubled ſoule can goe in his angry and zealous purſuit of ſinne, to bee reuenged vpon the ſame; namely, when he hath ſet hand vpon it, and got it vnder the hatchet, then to wreake all his anger vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

a companion of pride ioyned with the ſame, as will ſtrangle it to death before it come foorth: but a true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent childe of God doth make confeſſion of his ſinnes with ſhame and confuſion of face for them; yet not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nor caring for any ſhame amongſt men by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſinnes, nor what cauſe he hath to looke ſadly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but how he may in all humilitie looke vp with hope and comfort vnto God; hee careth not what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſoeuer God laieth vpon him, ſo as his ſinne may be taken away; he is ſtill crying out with <hi>Dauid, Lord take away mine iniquitie, and blot out all my ſinne:</hi> for the<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> nature of true repentance is to make a man aſhamed of ſinne, which hee hath committed, but not aſhamed with griefe to confeſſe it when it is done; but men are for the moſt part ſo full of ſelfe-loue, as they will not yeeld to make any other confeſſion of their ſinnes, then ſuch as will (as they thinke) ſtand with their owne outward ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie, credit and honour.</p>
               <p>Hypocrites are more generall in folding vp all their<note place="margin">2. <hi>Difference.</hi>
                  </note> ſinnes in a bundle together, when they come to make confeſſion of their ſinnes, regarding no more one then another of them; but ſhuffling of them together vpon a heape, they doe make a generall and confuſed kinde of confeſſion and acknowledgment of them, and ſuch alſo is their humiliation for them. But as in ſurfets taken in eating, ſome one kinde of meate intemperatly eaten, may be the principall cauſe of that ſurfet; ſo among many ſins there may be ſome one or two chiefe feſtring ſins, which doe lie rankling in mens conſciences, that require ſpeciall coſt to be beſtowed about them, and regard to be had of them.</p>
               <p>True penitents therefore doe deale more particularly, and looke to their ſpeciall and chiefe ſinnes, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with griefe of heart vnto God, making their beginning there; and hauing their thoughts moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to dwell vpon the conſideration of them. It is meet that men ſhould take ſeuerall repentances for their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:13967:169"/>
ſinnes, and for the vaine pleaſures and carnall delights they haue taken therein, that hauing had many vnlawfull pleaſures in ſinnes, they doe not ſhut vp all with one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance alone. There is a ſtorie, 2. Sam. 21. 1. that in <hi>Dauids</hi> time God ſent a plague vpon the land for a ſinne committed in the daies of <hi>Saul:</hi> if <hi>Dauid</hi> and his people were puniſhed for not regarding <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne; how much more liable was he to puniſhment, if he had not regarded his owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of his time? It was well ſaid by one, that if for the blood of the Martyrs ſhed in this land in Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> time, wee had had euery yeere ſince a faſt throughout the whole land for that blood ſhed, it had been little enough; how much more then for our owne proper ſinnes, and the ſinnes of this time, which now ouerflow the bankes both of religion and ciuill honeſtie? Where capitall and principall ſinnes that haue much angred the Lord, and greatly prouoked his diſpleaſure againſt the offenders, haue not in ſpeciall manner been bewailed, acknowledged and confeſſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, when men haue made their repentance, and humbled themſelues for their ſins, it hath come to paſſe, that ſuch as haue gone forward a great way in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, haue been faine to goe a great way backe againe to fetch better repentance, that they may repent for that which yet they neuer repented of: as in the time of Ezra. 10. 10. 11, the people hauing <hi>repented long,</hi> were faine <hi>to go back to fetch now repentance;</hi> and hauing <hi>faſted before,</hi> to <hi>faſt again, &amp; turne all mirth into mourning,</hi> becauſe they forgate <hi>a ſpeciall ſinne of marrying with ſtrange wiues.</hi> For as in an Euidence and writing for aſſurance, there may be left our ſuch words as ſhould be moſt effectuall in the conueiance, to the great preiudice of the lawfull owner, which muſt cauſe it to be new written againe: ſo in a mans repentance many things may be found out, which were forgotten at the firſt, to the great hindrance of a mans comfort. Hence it is that men often remember vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their death-beds, with much griefe of heart, the ſinnes
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:13967:169"/>
of their youth, their incontinencie, their pride, their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, their ſlanders and wrongs they haue done to their neighbours that are dead and gone, no ſatisfaction hauing been therefore made by them. And experience hath tried and taught this, that many, though they left their ſinnes long agoe, yet becauſe they did not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſoundly repent for them, they haue rebounded backe vpon them with terrible ſights and fearfull viſions, to humble them, and to bring them to a more ſerious examination of them, and better ſorrowing for them, though long ſince left, and in a manner quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>I doe not denie, but that hypocrites and reprobates<note place="margin">The confeſſion of Iudas.</note> may ſomtimes, through the great diſtreſſe of conſcience<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 3. 4.</note> that they are in, be brought to make a more particular confeſſion of their ſinnes, and to make ſpeciall mention of their moſt hainous and enormious vices, which they are guilty of, and which now haue brought them to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe wherein they are. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a rank hypocrite, and a cloſe cunning one, if euer there was any, yet he is ſaid to haue repented; and in the helliſh ſorrow that he was in, he made confeſſion of his ſin; yea he made confeſſion of his particular ſin, &amp; that openly, he cared not who heard him; and he confeſſed that ſinne that was of all his ſinnes the greateſt, and whereby hee had moſt offended: but becauſe it was without faith in Gods mercie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any true humbling of himſelfe before the Lord, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto him to haue it pardoned; and was made not in the true and perfect hatred of that ſinne, becauſe it was ſinne, but becauſe hee could keepe his owne counſell no longer; and the ouer-ruling hand of God would haue, that he ſhould penne his owne inditement, and confeſſe the action that he was guiltie of, the fact for which hee was in his conſcience now arraigned, before he ſhould be hanged; that being out of his owne mouth thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, all the world might know that hee died iuſtly damned. This confeſſion of his, though it was of his
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:13967:170"/>
particular ſinne, though it was of his chiefeſt and moſt hainous ſinne, and that openly made to his owne ſhame; yet was it no better then his ſatisfaction, when hee brought againe the money and caſt it a forehead from him: for nothing can bee well done in a wicked man, which yet would bee excellent, found done by a good man. Beſides, the confeſſion of <hi>Iudas</hi> was a falfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, made to wrong parties, ſuch as were guiltie of the ſame ſinne himſelfe had committed; and therefore were no way fit nor able to relieue him. He made his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to man, hee made none to God, whom hee had ſo greatly offended, to aske mercie of him; he humbled not himſelfe before his Lord and Maſter, whom moſt villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly aboue all he had wronged, to aske pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes at his hands, who only could helpe him; it was a confeſſion of deſperation, and not of hope; a confeſſion that had no true humiliation ioyned with it; a confeſſion more of the innocencie of Chriſt, then of the greatneſſe of that ſinne, by which hee had done all that miſchiefe that then was done: it was therefore but an effect of worldly and helliſh ſorrow, that cauſed his death and iuſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>But the humble confeſſion, which godly ſorrow in the<note place="margin">True confeſſion.</note> hearts of ſuch as are truly penitent doth cauſe them to make, is the reuerend and modeſt bluſhing of their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conſciences; they now putting themſelues to ſhame, not hiding their ſinnes any longer, but making open confeſſion of them both before God and men, when there is iuſt cauſe for them ſo to doe, with deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, with hope of obtaining mercie at the hands of God, and pardon for the ſame: and theſe doe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes, as it is done with an vtter loathing and perfect hating of them, as thoſe that haue no purpoſe at all to haue any more to doe with them from that time forward, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> who ſaid, Hoſ. 14. 8. <hi>What haue I to doe with Idols any more?</hi>
               </p>

as are vnſound in their repentance, is not a voluntarie humble confeſſion of ſinne in the griefe of their hearts that they haue done it, mooued by a loath ſome hating of it, that makes them ſo to throw it out, as ouerburdenſome longer to be kept: for they commonly doe not confeſſe their ſinnes, before their ſinnes be knowne in ſuch ſort, as the deniall of them is in vaine and without colour; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the confeſſion of ſinne bee extorted out of them, by the extremitie of ſome iudgement and plague vpon them.

Hypocrites come not to confeſſion, till they bee drawne out as by the eares to the making of it; as was <hi>Adam,</hi> Ioſh. 7. 18. and that they be arreſted and attached by ſome iudgements ſent from God: as the Lord was ſaid to haue taken <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo he was brought out to make his confeſſion. When they doe make their confeſſion, they do make it but by halues, and with their mouthes as halfe open, confeſſing ſomething, but not fully the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it was by them done. They confeſſe their ſinne as did <hi>Adam,</hi> who for all his confeſſing (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith of him, Iob 31. 33), <hi>yet did ſtill hide his ſinne;</hi> ſo doe theſe, making confeſſion of their ſinnes for all that keepe cloſe much ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie in their boſome. <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe his ſinne was knowne vnto the Lord, who now called to examination for the ſame, did indeede at the laſt with much adoe ſay, <hi>he had eaten:</hi> but hee kept cloſe <hi>his owne iniquitie</hi> in his boſome, and laid the whole blame of the fault vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon.

Yea doubtleſſe; and they that doe truly repent, though they had not ſuch outward ſhame put vpon them, yet would they with repentant <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Ierem. 31. 19. hauing truly repented and being turned, <hi>ſmite their owne hands vpon their thigh,</hi> and grow aſhamed of themſelues, yea euen confounded by bearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of their ſo doing amiſſe. And this their ſhame, howſoeuer for a time it may be their abaſing; yet being well carried, contentedly, conſcionably and meekly borne, it will afterward make to the lifting of them vp; to be had in better account with all that are good, and to haue the better credit and eſtimation among all them. <hi>Dauid</hi> committed a ſinne ſo groſſe in that kinde, as in many reſpects a groſſer could not lightly haue bin done; not a ſingle ſinne, but a compound ſinne, that had many other very grieuous and moſt hainous wickedneſſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp in it, and inwrapped with it, yea tied &amp; twiſted to it to ſtrengthen the euill of it, till it became hugely big, euen a very groſſe and grieuous ſin indeed; which could not bee but with great offence giuen to the Church of God, when it once became knowne. But who more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> then was <hi>Dauid?</hi> or who euer gaue the Church a better ſatisfaction then did hee? who ſpared not, beſides the confeſſing and acknowledging of it in <hi>words,</hi> though it were (as hee ſaid) againſt himſelfe, and to his owne ſhame, to publiſh it in <hi>writing,</hi> with his great ſorrow and repentance for the ſame; and ſuffered it to bee ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, yea not only to be ſpoken of, but alſo to bee ſung out openly aloud in the middeſt of the ſolemne aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Church-meetings throughout his whole land as it were, thereby gathering, and in a manner pulling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe the ſhame belonging vnto it from all the people of his whole land: and not only ſhaming himſelfe with it in his owne countrey, but alſo not refuſing to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:13967:178"/>
beare the ſhame of it in all other countries, and from all ſorts of people, among whom that which he had ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhould euer come to bee either read or heard: yea, as if it had not been enough to haue made it knowne to the people of that age alone, he hath ſo publiſhed it, as if it had been his meaning to tell all poſteritie of it, that we to this day, and all to the end of the world may know what was his fall, and how great his frailty was. Yet who doth not know that all this abaſing and caſting downe of himſelfe, and taking vpon him the ſhame of that hee had done, that ſo he might remoue the offence that was thereby giuen, and render vnto the Church the better and more full ſatisfaction, hath tended to the lifting vp of his honour higher in the Church of God; and hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and ſtill will cauſe him, not only to be as much reuerenced, but a great deale more admired for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rare grace, that by all this was manifeſted, then it is like he euer ſhould otherwiſe haue been, if happily that which hee ſo offended in, had neuer been by him done and ſo repented of?</p>
               <p>There is another kinde of ſatisfaction, which is a ciuill<note place="margin">3. To the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. 1.

                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:13967:179"/>The ſatisfaction then which tranſgreſſors of lawes are to make vnto ſocieties of men and Common-wealths thus wronged, is to beare and goe vnder, and contentedly to ſatisfie and pay the fines, mulcts, and penalties that are impoſed vpon offenders; and patiently without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſuffer impriſonments, chaſtiſements, &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yea euen vnto death it ſelfe, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and qualitie of the offence and crime that hath been committed, be it greater or leſſe.</p>
               <p>And herein alſo a cleane differing carriage is found to<note place="margin">Difference in impenitents.</note> be by the delinquents on both ſides: vnſanctified perſons whoſe conſciences are neuer ſoundly touched with true remorſe for committing any ſinne, neither for violating wholeſome and good lawes, what wrong ſoeuer that way hath been done by them, they ſtand not vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any recompence, or giuing ſatisfaction ſo farre as they are able to tender their goods, where they are found ſufficient to make it; or to yeeld their bodies where their goods cannot doe it; or patiently to lay downe their liues, in caſes; wherein nothing elſe can be found ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fully to ſatisfie: but they ſeeke ſhifts how to auoid all; if they be great in the world, they ſtand vpon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues, their greatneſſe muſt allow them to bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; they are like the great flies which doe breake through the cobwebs, they will not bee taken, there is nothing can hold them.

If they be put by all their muſes, and preuented of all their courſes, and no remedie but to the gallowes they muſt come, there men of this ſort are found to die either moſt deſperately, as thoſe who after all the wrongs they offered to others all their life time, ſticke not to wrong God and nature it ſelfe in the end, by careleſly, yea madly caſting away their life; (as though it were a thing but vile, which God hath made ſo precious, and nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all to be ſo charie of, to ſtand ſo much for, &amp; to make ſo much of) as daily may bee ſeene.

                  <hi>to be throwne into the den of Lions, for not obeying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Darius, which as a law of Medes and Perſians might not be broken:</hi> whoſe examples the bleſſed Martyrs of God haue ſince worthily followed. And ſuch kind of tranſgreſſors of lawes as this ſecond ſort are, that haue been now mentioned, are not to bee ranked vp among rebels; neither are to bee euery way counted as perſons that are diſobedient: for there muſt be a diſtinction made of obedience; there is an <hi>obedience in doing,</hi> and there is an <hi>obedience in ſuffering:</hi> now where that which the Law commandeth cannot ſo ſafely with a good conſcience, or readily be done; if that which the Law ſetteth downe as puniſhment to be inflicted for it, bee patiently borne, there is then another obedience ſhewed, and a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giuen for the want of the former, and for that which elſe could not be done. <hi>Daniel</hi> though he diſobeyed the commandement of the King, in the doing of that, (though it were a law of the Medes and Perſians, which<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 22.</note> being once made, might not be broken) that hee might obey God the better, yet iuſtified himſelfe in that he had done; and ſaid plainly to the King, that he had done him no wrong, he was no rebell, hee was no vndutifull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: which may be ſaid for others of Gods ſeruants in the like caſe and reſpect.</p>
               <p>There is yet another kind of ſatisfaction, and that is<note place="margin">4. <hi>Priuate and particular men.</hi>
                  </note> more particular and priuate betweene man and man,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:13967:181"/>
when wrong is offered to any man. And this is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be made by euery perſon that is truly penitent, if he would either giue teſtimony to others that his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ſound, or take comfort to himſelfe that his ſinnes ſhall euer be pardoned. For <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath well ſet that<note place="margin">Non remittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum. Auguſt.</note> downe, there is no looking for pardon for the ſinne, if that which was taken away be not reſtored againe. And this did <hi>Daniel</hi> giue in counſell to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> who had been a great ſpoyler, waſter and vndoer of the greateſt part of the world, he hauing vndone many, and made them poore, he counſelleth him to make ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction vnto them againe; and ſo breake off his ſinnes by <hi>exerciſing now more righteouſneſſe, and ſhewing mercy to the poore:</hi> whom in ſome ſort hee ſhall ſatisfie for the wrongs before hee had done them in ſpoyling of them, if now againe hee will ſuccour them, and helpe them in their need.</p>
               <p>Hypocrites and worldly-minded perſons, they haue<note place="margin">Difference in hypocrites.</note> no skill of this reſtitution, nor will, to make this kind of ſatisfaction: if they haue got any thing (that is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how) that they thinke to bee their owne; that they will hold faſt; and they will be ſure to part with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They are of their religion that will neither doe right to others, nor take any wrong to themſelues. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they goe not ſo farre as <hi>Iudas</hi> (that notable hypocrite) did; nor doe not ſo much as did he: the money that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> had gotten for ſelling his Maſter, was as iuſtly and as lawfully his, as the money of many is theirs that they come by: for it was his by buying and ſelling, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his bargaine: now it was as lawfully his, as the money that men ſell good corne for, and put chaffe and droſſe into it: and as the money that men get by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and vſurie; who feeling the ſweetneſſe of gaining, care not how they come by money, though it were by ſucking out the very life-blood of the owners thereof, ſo they may haue it. But though theſe know and feele the ſweetneſſe of the comming of it in, they know not with
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:13967:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what bitterneſſe it will goe out againe. <hi>Iudas</hi> might haue kept his money by any law of the land; he had ſold and performed his bargaine; and why might hee not haue kept the money that hee had therefore gotten? but his conſcience ſo pincht him and prickt him for his treaſon againſt his Maſter, whom he had ſold to get this money; it being the purchaſe of that his iniquitie, and knowing how vnlawfully he had got it, his hands could hold it no longer, he was neuer quiet till he had brought it againe, and giuen it to them of whom he had it, though that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would quiet him; for nothing was done as it ſhould be ſoundly by him: his repentance was a falſe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and this ſatisfaction a falſe fruit of the ſame. What then may be hoped for of them that goe not ſo farre in making ſatisfaction, and reſtoring againe that which they haue moſt vniuſtly taken, as this damned diuell <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did, who is now in hell??</p>
               <p>But they that are truly penitent indeed for their ſinne, whatſoeuer wrong they either know themſelues, or can be ſhewed by others that they haue offered to any man, either in his perſon, in his name, or in his goods; they neuer can be quiet till they naue made the partie ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and that to the full, if their ability will extend ſo farre, that ſo it may be performed by them. If meanes bee wanting that they cannot doe as they would, they ſhew themſelues more penitent; and by a greater ſubmiſſion they humble themſelues before the parties wronged; and aske them forgiueneſſe of that which they cannot make any better ſatisfaction for. And in ſuch kind of wrongs wherein others haue been wronged in their goods, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniuſtly taken away, or wrongfully with-held by them, if the parties be dead to whom ſuch wrong hath been offered, then ſeeke they out who are left that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto them, and were neereſt of their kinne, that to them they may make a full reſtitution and ſatisfaction for the wrong. If none ſuch can be found to bee liuing, they will rather bring it to the Church for holy vſe, and ſee
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:13967:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the poore to haue it diſtributed among them, then they will keepe pennie or pennies-worth thereof: which as the plague, would infect all they had beſide, and fret as a canker, till it had conſumed whatſoeuer before had been iuſtly gotten, and which with good peace they might haue ſtill poſſeſſed well, and kept lawfully as their owne. This care to make reſtitution they haue learned from the practice of that bleſſed penitent, and ſaued-conuert, rich <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who hauing been a great piller and powler of the people, in the day that <hi>ſaluation by Chriſt was brought to his houſe,</hi> ſtood forth and ſaid, <hi>Lord, halfe of my goods I giue to the poore; and if I haue taken any thing from any man by forged accuſation, I reſtore him foure-fold.</hi> Thus much touching confeſſion and ſatisfaction; which two do neuer faile to accompany that ſorrow eſpecially which is godly, that cauſeth repentance neuer to be repented of, being repentance vnto life.</p>
